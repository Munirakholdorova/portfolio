This repository contains all materials for my mini-project on illegal working in the UK, analysed exclusively through BBC News reports. The project examines which employment sectors are most frequently associated with illegal working and includes corpus construction, data cleaning, keyword tagging, geographic analysis, and visualisation. The repository is organised into three main folders that reflect the different stages of the research workflow.
The corpus folder contains all collected BBC News articles and the structured CSV files used throughout the analysis. These CSV files were progressively updated as the project developed. The initial cleaned CSV file included only the article text, title, publication date, URL, and year. In a subsequent stage, an additional column was added to record employment sectors identified through keyword tagging. In the final stage, geographic information at both local and large-region levels, extracted from BBC navigation breadcrumbs, was added as further columns. This incremental updating of the CSV files created a clear and systematic workflow, allowing the dataset to grow iteratively as new layers of analysis were introduced.
The scripts folder contains all scripts developed and used during the project. These include web scraping scripts for downloading BBC News articles, HTML parsing scripts for cleaning text and removing extraneous elements such as advertisements, navigation menus, and image captions, and keyword tagging scripts for identifying employment sectors. The folder also includes scripts for extracting geographic information and aggregating GeoJSON data for regional mapping. Multiple versions of the scripts are preserved to document the iterative process of refining methods and addressing challenges, such as preventing duplicate sector counts within single articles and aggregating GeoJSON data to represent larger areas such as London.
The visualizations folder contains all graphical outputs produced during the project. These include static Loliport visualisations showing the frequency of illegal working across employment sectors, as well as a line graph depicting the number of BBC News articles published per year between 2010 and 2024, highlighting trends and peaks in media coverage. The folder also includes an interactive choropleth map of smaller regions in England, where article counts are displayed when hovering over each region. While this map provides useful exploratory insights, some regions are not mapped accurately and the absence of labels limits readability; these aspects could be improved in future iterations. All HTML files required for interactive visualisations are included to ensure direct access.
Overall, this folder structure reflects a clear and progressive workflow from data collection and corpus cleaning through to analysis and visualisation. By preserving both intermediate and final outputs, the repository ensures transparency, reproducibility, and a clear record of methodological decision-making throughout the project.
