Seven of them were ""detained for removal"", it said.Click to expandTap the questions belowHow many people are returned or deported from the UK?The government requires people who are in the UK, but no longer have permission to live or work in the country, to leave.This is called a return and can happen voluntarily or involuntarily.People can lose the right to be in the UK for different reasons, such as a visa expiring, an asylum claim being refused, or by receiving a criminal conviction that results in deportation.There were 36,457 returns from October 2024 to September 2025. This was up by 11% on the same period the previous year.That number of returns is equivalent to about 5% of total emigration from the UK from July 2024 to June 2025.Who is returned from the UK?Of all returns from October 2024 to September 2025:5,343 had been convicted of a criminal offence10,958 had lodged an asylum claim at some point2,272 had arrived in the UK by small boatPeople from India made up 24% of all returns from October 2024 to September 2025.What is the 'one in, one out' deal with France?The UK istrialing a scheme with Franceto return people who arrived in the country on a small boat.For every person the UK sends back to France, the UK will accept an equal number of asylum seekers.This is called the ""one in, one out"" deal. As of 27 November 2025, 153 people have been returned through this arrangement.How do people leave the UK under immigration control?Returns can happen in different ways. ""Enforced returns"", which includes deportations, means the government arranges transport to return people to a different country. In some cases, people are escorted by officers.All other returns are ""voluntary"". This means a person has agreed to leave and may receive government help with travel and other costs to help facilitate the return.Some people classed as leaving the country voluntarily do so completely independently and withoutany government knowledge or involvement.Independent returns made up 33% of the total from October 2024 to September 2025.See more key stats on hotels, small boats and asylumAsylum seekers are generally not allowed to undertake paid work during their first 12 months in the UK, or until their asylum application is approved.But earlier this year the Sun newspaper reported that Channel migrants were able to rent accounts from legitimate delivery firm workers via social media groups.The government said at the time that ""illicit account sharing"" had been facilitating illegal work.The Home Office says it has recently been sharing the locations of asylum hotels with food delivery companies so they can ""monitor hotspots for illegal working"".Deliveroo, Just Eat and Uber Eats say they have increased randomised facial checks to ensure riders match their account names.The Home Office added in a statement that it had made 8,000 arrests last year for illegal working - a 63% rise on the previous 12 months.The Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill introduces new laws to expand right to work checks to the gig economy, including on delivery riders.Though asylum seekers cannot work in the UK during their first 12 months in the country, they are allowed to volunteer.In September, Mahmood proposed thatvolunteering would become compulsoryfor them to be granted permanent settlement status.But more than 300 charities wrote anopen letter,externalto the Home Secretary last month saying they would not comply with these proposals, calling the move ""exploitation"".Related topicsTakeaway foodHome OfficeImmigrationMore on this storyFood delivery apps to tighten checks to stop illegal workersPublished30 JuneIs the government meeting its pledges on illegal immigration and asylum?Published6 days agoTrack UK's latest migration numbers - including asylum, visas and small boatsPublished2 hours ago"

All three apps use daily facial recognition to verify couriers, among other checks including Right to Work documents.Verification checks are intended to prevent registered couriers ""renting out"" their accounts to those who do not have the right to work in the UK.In a report, South Yorkshire Police said: ""Since January 2024, the city centre neighbourhood team has seized over 200 e-bikes and e-scooters, with approximately 10% of those seizures leading to further arrests for more serious offences such as drug supply and possession of offensive weapons.""This approach also uncovered that a significant number of asylum seekers with no right to work were being employed as delivery riders and also potential victims of modern slavery.""The city centre policing team conducts weekly targeted operations to tackle anti-social behaviour, with e-bikes being a strand of this.""This is subject to daily patrols and regularly has more concerted days of action with immigration officers and plain clothed officers.

But a financial crime investigator told the BBC he believes it goes much wider.The Home Office said it will investigate the BBC's findings.Reaction to BBC investigation - crime network 'pull factor' for illegal migrants, say MPsPublished5 NovemberReacting to our investigation, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, said: ""Illegal working and linked organised criminality creates an incentive for people to come here illegally. We will not stand for it.""For the first time, we can reveal the inner workings of a criminal system that lets asylum seekers work in plain sight on UK High Streets, in mini-marts that mainly profit from illegal cigarettes and vapes.One man told us weekly takings from illicit tobacco at his shop could be ""sometimes, up to Â£3,000"".The men who facilitate it all - so-called ""ghost directors"" - each have dozens of businesses listed on Companies House but in many cases are not involved in running them.""The shop doesn't belong to me, it's just under my name,"" one of them told our undercover reporters.Many of the businesses are dissolved after about a year, and then re-opened with small changes to official paperwork.These businesses have ""all the red flags"" associated with organised criminality, a financial crime investigator told the BBC.During our investigation we found:An asylum seeker, who says his claim was rejected, trying to sell a shop to our undercover reporter for Â£18,000A Kurdish Facebook group listing dozens of mini-marts, barbers, car washes and takeaways for sale""Ghost directors"" charging illegal workers up to Â£300 per month to register mini-marts in their namesKurdish builders offering to build elaborate hiding spaces for illegal cigarettes and vapes that would fool sniffer dogsAsylum seekers, who said the Home Office had left them in legal limbo, working 14-hour shifts in mini-marts for as little as Â£4 per hourThe two Kurdish journalists involved in our investigation know that tensions over immigration are high. They worry that such coverage of illegal activities within the Kurdish community could inflame hostilities.One of them is a former asylum seeker himself, and says ""I wanted to play a role in uncovering these illegal activities [...] to say loudly that they don't represent us.""Image caption,We found dozens of posts advertising mini-marts for sale across the UKOver four months, we monitored a Kurdish Facebook group where businesses across the UK were listed for sale.New adverts popped up every week.The reporters got in touch with three people who listed mini-marts for sale in Crewe, Hull and Liverpool. They said they were interested in running a mini-mart and trading illegal cigarettes.In Cheshire, the man running a Crewe mini-mart called Top Store said he would sell his shop to one reporter for Â£18,000 cash.The shopkeeper, who went by the name Surchi, assured our journalist that ""you don't need anything"" to own and run a mini-mart as an asylum seeker.Surchi told us he was himself a Kurdish asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK in 2022, but whose claim had been refused.When the BBC later confronted him, he told us he had paperwork proving his right to work. We asked if he could show us these documents, but he hasn't provided them.Asylum seekers generally do not have the right to work in the UK while their claim is being processed. Permission to work is only granted in limited circumstances and is subject to strict conditions.If asylum seekers are granted permission to work, they can only apply for eligible jobs on the Immigration Salary List.These do not include being a shop manager or shop assistant.Like our undercover reporters, Surchi told us he was from the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq, an area that straddles the borders of Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria. The region is often referred to as Kurdistan, but it is not an independent country.To avoid scrutiny by the authorities, Surchi said he paid someone called ""Hadi"" about Â£250 a month to be named on official papers.""That's his job and he probably has 40 to 50 shops under his name. There's no problem, he doesn't mind what you sell,"" he explained.This arrangement let Surchi go under the radar of immigration enforcement and sell whatever he liked. He said he had never paid any council tax and that our undercover reporter would not need to officially register the company.Immigration enforcement officers had only come by once in the past five years, when he was out, Surchi said during his sales patter. They never returned, he said.Image caption,Shopkeeper Surchi, right, talked to one of our undercover journalists about buying his mini-mart for Â£18,000Trading Standards had raided the shop once, Surchi said, and he had been given a Â£200 fine for selling illegal cigarettes and vapes.Shop owners in the UK caught selling these items can be fined up to Â£10,000, but the profits that can be made from such products far outweigh the penalties.During a tour of the premises, Surchi took us outside to a so-called ""stash car"" where he said he hid the bulk of his stock until 17:00 each night, when Trading Standards officers finished for the day.He also told our reporter that ""you could make a hiding spot"" for the stock in the shop's basement - where he also showed how he tampered with the electricity meter to avoid paying utility bills.Surchi sold vapes to a group of teenagers while we were at the shop. ""I have customers that are 12 years old, I don't have any problem with them,"" he said.Customers paid via a card machine into a bank account, he explained. Both of these belonged to his cousin, he said, who owned a mini-mart 15 miles away in Stoke.'Fine craftsmanship' to fool sniffer dogsOn Facebook, we discovered Kurdish builders willing to help us conceal illegal vapes and cigarettes.One of our reporters posted that he had bought a mini-mart in Manchester and was looking for ""a specialist to build a space to hide cigarettes in the shop"".Six builders got in touch. One sent us a video of what looked like a vending machine for illegal cigarettes hidden in a loft, which, at the press of a button, pinged packets down a chute to a concealed vent below.It was ""fine craftsmanship"" and cost Â£6,000, the builder said, claiming it was guaranteed to fool Trading Standards' sniffer dogs.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption,Watch: Hidden cigarettes dispenser to avoid sniffer dog detectionA network of ghost directorsAs we delved deeper into who officially owned these mini-marts, a network of ghost directors began to emerge.One name that kept coming up was Hadi Ahmad Ali - the Birmingham man to whom Surchi told us he was paying his monthly fee. We found Mr Ahmad Ali listed on Companies House as being from Iraq, in his 40s and a director of more than 50 other businesses - mini-marts, barbers and car washes.One of our reporters phoned him pretending to be an asylum seeker looking to buy the Crewe business to sell illegal cigarettes. Mr Ahmad Ali said the shop didn't belong to him but the lease was under his name. He confirmed he could keep it in his name for our undercover reporter, for a fee of between Â£250 and Â£300 a month.He also said he could try to provide a bank card for the shop.""I will give you a 50% guarantee that I can get you a bank card. I have another six to seven shops under my name in Hull and other places.""Mr Ahmad Ali is still listed as an active director on several businesses on Companies House. We later learned that in October 2024 he had been disqualified from being a company officer for five years.Image caption,We linked Hadi Ahmad Ali (L) and Ismaeel Farzanda (R) to more than 70 businesses - including mini-marts, carwashes and barbershopsThe ban followed illegal cigarette sales at a shop in his name in Chorley, Lancashire - including to a 16-year-old.Separately, he pleaded guilty to his involvement in the sale of illegal cigarettes in Lincolnshire and was sentenced to six months in prison, suspended for 18 months.When later confronted by the BBC, Mr Ahmad Ali told us these mini-marts were nothing to do with him, and he had contacted Companies House to get his name removed from the businesses.A spokesperson for Companies House said it ""now has greater powers to share information and support law enforcement investigations"".""Where criminality is suspected, information and intelligence are shared with relevant partners.""Our research linked Mr Ahmad Ali to another man, Ismael Ahmedi Farzanda, who we found was a ghost director and responsible for 25 mini-marts.Mr Farzanda's name came up because Companies House filings showed he had taken over as company director from Mr Ahmad Ali at seven mini-mart businesses. The pair also shared a co-directorship on one shop in Blackpool.One of our reporters managed to call Mr Farzanda, using the same cover story as he had told Mr Ahmad Ali.""I just put the shops under my name for people,"" said Mr Farzanda who, like Mr Ahmad Ali, was based in the West Midlands. He told us an ""accountant"" would take care of the paperwork, bank accounts and payments to him, and that he would have no problem with us selling illegal cigarettes.The only request he had was that if the undercover reporter was ever caught by the police, he should let him know immediately.""If you know you're caught, tell us so that for the interviews we can change the name and not get in trouble,"" he told our reporter.Mr Farzanda was fined Â£4,500 in August after one shop, registered in his name in Haslingden, Lancashire, was caught selling illegal vapes to a 14-year-old, according to local media reports.Seventeen shops registered under the names of Mr Ahmad Ali and Mr Farzanda have been raided since 2021 with illegal tobacco and vapes seized, Trading Standards sources confirmed.'Endless battle': Fighting the crime gangs taking over the high streetPublished31 JulyThe sale of illegal cigarettes signals a deeper problem with UK high streetsPublished3 JulyPolice raid barbers and vape shops suspected of being fronts for crime gangsPublished10 AprilTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption,Confronting the ""ghost directors"" behind the networkDespite being registered on official documents as being from Iran, Mr Farzanda told our undercover reporter he was actually from the Sharazoor district in neighbouring Iraq.Both our undercover reporters say they are aware of Kurdish people who have arrived in the UK on small boats and pretended to be Iranian, believing their asylum claims would have a better chance of success.When later presented with our evidence, Mr Farzanda denied all the allegations put to him by the BBC.When we looked into the official records attached to all the companies listed for Mr Ahmad Ali and Mr Farzanda, a suspicious pattern emerged.We found companies would be set up for a year, dissolved, and then set up again - each time with a slightly different spelling of the businesses' names.

It's most likely to evade tax and to dodge scrutiny by authorities,"" said financial crime investigator Graham Barrow, when we showed him our data.We have also confirmed details of two further ghost directors - with 40 companies listed between them.This UK-wide network of more than 100 company directorships in the names of just four individuals has ""all the red flags that I would associate with organised criminal networks"", said Mr Barrow.The network of businesses identified by the BBC could stretch even wider across the country, said Mr Barrow: ""I certainly think it's hundreds. It could easily be bigger than that,"" he said.We visited more than a dozen mini-marts linked to this network of ghost directors.Everywhere we went, it was the same story - the shops were on rundown High Streets in some of the UK's most deprived areas, such as Blackpool, Bradford, Huddersfield and Hull.All but one of the shops sold counterfeit or smuggled cigarettes for about Â£4 per pack, instead of the average UK price of Â£16 for a pack of 20.Image caption,The sale of illegal cigarettes and vapes costs the country at least Â£2.2bn in lost revenue, according to the HMRCAs well as Surchi's story in Crewe, our investigation revealed details of other Kurdish asylum seekers being employed illegally.A mini-mart worker in a Blackpool shop linked to one of the ghost directors told us he had left an asylum-seeker hotel in Liverpool to work 14-hour days at the shop. ""In return I get Â£60 to Â£65 [per day],"" he told us. ""For three months, I worked for Â£50 [per day].""He was interviewed by the Home Office four months ago, he said, but hasn't heard anything since. The shop had been raided by Trading Standards three times, he told us - but he described that as ""nothing"".""Just give them any name and they will walk away,"" he explained, saying that whenever he was asked who he was, he would give the name of a famous Kurdish singer, Aziz Waisi.He did say he was worried by immigration enforcement, however. ""They [Trading Standards] take the cigarettes and leave, but immigration makes you do fingerprints.""We also found another Kurdish shopworker in a Salford shop registered under Ismaeel Farzanda's name, who said he was in limbo.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c740vjrp81po,Will digital ID cards stop illegal working?,2025-09-26T14:05:04.409Z,"Will digital ID cards stop illegal working?Image source,Getty ImagesByDaniel SandfordUK correspondentPublished26 September 2025ID cards have always been viewed with suspicion in the UK. For some people they can conjure up images of authoritarian states like Germany in the 1930s, and men in jackboots barking ""May we see your papers please?""There were two periods when we had compulsory ID cards here in Britain. The first was during World War One. The second was from the beginning of World War Two until the early 1950s.When the system was abandoned in 1952, an editorial in the Guardian said: ""In this country we do not like this sort of thing. Better a little evasion and inefficiency than too much petty bureaucratic interference with the individual.""The last attempt to introduce an ID scheme, in 2006, was born through familiar concerns about immigration and illegal working, as well as worries about benefit fraud and terrorism. It was scrapped by the coalition government when they came to power in 2010.Fifteen years on, Sir Keir Starmer is proposing something slightly different. Not an ID card, but a digital ID scheme. It is a way of proving your identity, and your right to work in the UK, using modern smartphone technology.Though the government also says it ""will ensure that it works for those who aren't able to use a smartphone, with inclusion at the heart of its design"". How that would be achieved is not yet clear, though it might mean people without a smartphone have to use a physical ID card.What is the plan for digital IDs and will they be mandatory?Digital ID is being sold by Downing Street as a way of reducing illegal working by migrants who do not have the right to earn wages in Britain.The rules are already - in theory - quite tough. Employers can be fined Â£60,000 per illegal employee if they have not done the correct checks.The government says the proposed new digital ID - which will cost the user nothing - ""will be the authoritative proof of who someone is and their residency status in this country"".It will include the holder's name, date of birth, photograph, and information on nationality or residency status.Instead of involving a physical card linked to a National Identity Register, this new proposal is more a proof of identity scheme. As well as proving a person's right to work the government promise that it will in future ""make it simpler to apply for services like driving licences, childcare and welfare.""Ministers say that ""by the end of the parliament"" digital ID will be compulsory when checking someone's right to work. They claim that this will in turn reduce on of the ""key pull factors"" for people arriving in the UK in small boats.""You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID"", the prime minister said. ""It is as simple as that.""A more secure way of people proving their identity might reduce illegal working, and avoid the proliferation of fake documents in circulation.At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy - but the idea is a picture would make it - in theory - harder to abuse that system.But former Home Office official David Rennie said he did not believe the plan would have ""any bearing on people coming to this country illegally"".""It's the black economy - by its nature, they're not performing right to work checks,"" he told BBC Radio 4's the World at One.Mr Rennie, who now works at Orchestrating Identity - a company that performs these checks - acknowledged the system had ""gaps"" and could be improved, with some people finding it difficult to prove they could work in the UK.""But that doesn't mean that you have to implement, at great expense to the taxpayer, a digital identity system for the whole country. They should really focus on improving what they've already put in place.""Jill Rutter, of the Institute for Government, has meanwhile emphasised the need for ""stronger Labour market enforcement"" alongside the scheme.""People are paying cash, people are working in what the prime minister calls the 'shadow economy',"" she said.""It means people won't have an excuse for not checking, saying 'I thought they were British', and people won't be able to use fake ID so easily.""So it will help, but I don't think it's an absolute panacea.""The scheme will also take time. The phrase ""by the end of the parliament"" is shorthand for 2028, when the next general election is most likely to take place. This is not something that can be done in a year.Most EU countries have some sort of ID scheme. One of the most modern ones is in Estonia where the focus is less on preventing illegal working, and more on easy access to things like benefits and health records.But in countries like France and Germany, which both have long-running ID schemes, illegal working is still a problem. Though the French have long-complained that one of the pull factors to the UK for people crossing the channel in small boats is that it is even easier to work illegally in Britain than it is in France.Related topicsKeir StarmerMore on this storyNew digital ID will be mandatory to work in the UKPublished26 September"

""Once we get settled in a place, then they move us,"" she saidSome asylum seekers saying they had no choice but to work illegally for as little as Â£20 a day to pay off debts to people smugglersOur snapshot of conditions inside the four hotels raises wider questions for the government, with a large backlog of asylum claims having led to a reliance on this costly emergency accommodation for tens of thousands of people.We asked the government how much it spends on taxi travel for asylum seekers through a Freedom of Information Act request, but the Home Office told us it does not keep these figures.Mr Pennycook told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was ""questionable"" why asylum seekers needed to take such long taxi journeys and said the government would ""look into those cases"". But he said asylum seekers were not ""ordinary citizens just jumping on a bus"".Asked why asylum seekers who had lost appeals still had access to the NHS, the minister said the government was tightening legislation ""so that our immigration rules are no longer abused"", because some people ""cycle regularly"" between multiple appeals.All the names of the hotel residents and staff Sue Mitchell met have been changed to protect their identitiesIn one of the hotels, as I eat a meal cooked on the floor of a shower, I realise nothing has prepared me for what life is like for the residents of an asylum hotel.I have been invited to join Kadir and his family for dinner - not in the hotel restaurant, but up in the rooms where he lives with his wife, Mira, and their three children.An electric cable, covered in thick insulating tape, has been extended into the bathroom. Behind the door, Mira is crouching over a small cooker in the shower tray. Pans are precariously placed on a hob and she is stirring away.As a pan full of oil starts to spit, I worry about the smoke alarm, but I needn't bother. The sensor in the room has been sealed tight with plastic bags.Image caption,To avoid the smoke alarm being triggered by cooking, a sensor is covered with plastic bagsThis set-up is illegal and unsafe, but Kadir tells me his family would rather take the risk and make their own meals, than settle for the free hotel restaurant fare provided.He dismisses that as ""chips and chicken nuggets"" and says hotel residents have complained it makes them feel ill.The smell of herbs and spices wafting through the corridors seems to suggest they are not the only ones who feel this way.""Everybody, they're cooking in their rooms like this,"" claims Kadir. ""We all do it, but we do it undercover.""Image caption,Some of the asylum seekers cook meals inside their hotel roomsOf the four hotels I visited this summer for File on 4 Investigates, two sites accommodated families, while the others were for single people - most of them men.But the stories in every hotel were similar.To protect the safety of residents and staff, I am not saying where the hotels are.I heard from families who have been waiting in the UK for nearly a decade for their cases to be decided - and from people who have had babies in the misguided belief that doing so will automatically guarantee mother and child being given British passports.There were uplifting stories of human spirit - including an elderly couple, both with serious health problems, who still managed to help others in their hotel with food and emotional support.But, at the same time, I have seen signs of hotel residents working illegally in the black economy and discovered that the asylum system appears to require an extraordinary number of taxi journeys.Image source,AFP via Getty ImagesImage caption,August 2025: Protesters call for the closure of an asylum hotel in Epping, EssexThe government has pledged to end the use of asylum hotels by 2029. They currently houseabout 32,000 people across the UK,external, down from 51,000 in 2023.Asylum hotels - including two of those I visited - have become a focus for vocal and sometimes violent protests this summer, after a resident of one hotel in Epping, Essex, sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl.Journalists aren't normally allowed inside the hotels, but I gained access through migrant contacts who had made the journey across the English Channel from France.The hotels were never intended to be used like this. The rooms look smart on review sites on the internet - with sofas, televisions, double beds, ensuite bathrooms. Everything is there, and you would be pleased if one was yours for a couple of nights.What the pictures don't show is the wear-and-tear and the build-up of possessions that come from continuous occupancy over months and years.Where reception once was, there are now security desks. Outside, there are bollards and warnings that the public aren't allowed in.File on 4 Investigates: Inside the Migrant HotelIn recordings made as demonstrations unfold, Sue Mitchell takes listeners into the closed world of the migrant hotels.Listen on SoundsListen now BBC Sounds or on Tuesday 23 September at 20:00 on BBC Radio 4At the hotels housing families, I am struck by the number of prams in the reception areas, and by how many babies and toddlers there are. With little or no communal space, younger children are left to play in empty corridors.In one of the hotels, a friendly security guard, Curtis, shows me a makeshift running track he has set up for the children in an unused car park - and the bikes in the storeroom he has found and repaired.When I ask the Home Office how many children have been born in asylum hotels, it tells me there are no figures available.One of the first babies I meet is proudly held aloft by his father - they arrived from Somalia just weeks earlier and he tells me this is a ""British baby"", born on ""British soil"", who will, one day he believes, hold a British passport.This is not, in fact, the case. The Home Office can still deport asylum seekers who have babies in the UK, although, according to Jon Featonby of the Refugee Council, there are extra safeguards which make it harder to forcibly remove them.Kadir and Mira - the couple who cooked me a meal - have also had a baby since being in the UK. Kadir says he, his wife and their two older children were forced to flee Iraq. In his home country, Kadir says he had worked as a translator but was targeted by criminals.The family has been moved between different hotels all over the UK since they arrived nine years ago. The Home Office initially rejected Kadir's case because of what it said was lack of proof. Two unsuccessful appeals followed. A third is currently under way.The family occupies two adjoining hotel rooms - one for Kadir, Mira and their baby, and the other for their 12-year-old daughter, Shayan, and 14-year-old son, Roman.Image source,Joe Dixie/BBCImage caption,Some children in the hotels have spent their whole lives thereKadir says he wants to work, but won't do so illegally. However, he says he knows plenty of hotel residents who seek to supplement the Â£9.95 a week they receive from the government.Kadir introduces me to Mohammed, who arrived from Afghanistan a few weeks ago.Mohammed fixed up a job before he even hit UK soil, he says, as his cousin was already here and working illegally. He is now earning Â£20 a day for shifts that he says can last 10 hours, sometimes longer.When I challenge Mohammed on why he is breaking the law, he says he has no choice because his family owes money to people-smugglers. It is a story I hear from other asylum seekers too.Mohammed wants to send money back to his wife in the hope that one day - if he is allowed to remain in the UK - she will be able to join him.Image caption,Mira (left) and her daughter ShayanIn all four migrant hotels I visit, there are men and women coming and going at times that suggest they are working. Sometimes, delivery bikes are parked around the side of the buildings and occasionally vans pick people up.In July, the Home Office conducted a UK-widecrackdown on illegal delivery drivers,external. It says 1,780 individuals were stopped and spoken to, leading to 280 arrests for illegal working activity. â¯A total of 53 people are now having their support reviewed as a result.Staff in the hotel tell me it isn't their job to check these things, but security guard Curtis says he is not surprised. ""You've got nothing to occupy these guys. So of course, they're going to go out there and work.""There seems to be a constant stream of cabs arriving and leaving the four sites I visit - although the Home Office says it doesn't have figures for the amount of money it spends on taxis at asylum hotels.Image caption,Taxis are booked on an automated systemWhile residents are issued with a bus pass for one return journey per week, for any other necessary travel - for example, a visit to the doctor - taxis are called.Proof of an upcoming appointment needs to be shown at the reception desk, where a taxi is booked on an automated system. Public transport or walking is not presented as an option.This can result in some unusually long journeys and others that are unusually short.For instance, when migrants move between hotels, they sometimes keep the same NHS doctors - especially for GP referrals. Kadir says a knee problem meant he was told to take a 250-mile taxi ride to see the consultant who had treated him at his old address. He says the taxi driver told him the return journey cost Â£600.""Should the Home Office give me the ticket for the train? This is the easy way, and they know they spend too much money,"" Kadir says. ""We know as well, but we don't have any choice. It's crazy.""I accompany Mira and Shayan as they go for a walk to a local chemist to pick up a prescription. It means braving a line of protesters shouting ""Go home!"" at them. They keep their heads down as police escort them through.Why do Channel migrants want to come to the UK?Published9 July'People are angry': Behind the wave of asylum hotel protestsPublished9 AugustLater, I ask 12-year-old Shayan how she feels about the protests.She says she wants to engage with the protesters and is frustrated the hotel staff won't allow her: ""Me and my friends have always wanted to go up to them and speak to them face-to-face. What is their problem with the kids as well?""Shayan and her brother say they are often reluctant to take the school bus that comes to collect them each weekday. ""You never know what [the protesters] will do to the bus,"" she says, adding that she is afraid one of them might try to board it.She wants to stay in the UK, she says, but her life so far has been spent in uncertain circumstances: ""Once we get settled in a place, then they move us, and then we've got to learn where we come from, like, learn that area, go to a new school, make new friends, and then once we've done that, they move us again.""The Home Office says it is identifying more suitable relocation sites for asylum seekers, such as disused buildings and former military facilities.In the meantime, ""we expect all providers to uphold the highest standards in preserving the safety, security, and wellbeing of those in their care"", said a spokesperson.Since talking to me at the asylum hotel, Kadir and his family have been told they are to be moved on once more - to two hotels in different cities. Kadir and his baby daughter have been offered accommodation in one hotel, and Mira, Shayan and Roman in another, nearly 200 miles away.But they are refusing to go. Kadir has already been told he has lost his weekly benefit and there is a chance the family will be deemed to have made themselves intentionally homeless.The future for the family - like many other asylum seekers - remains anything but certain.Get in touchYour Voice: What story do you want BBC News to cover?Contact formContact formRelated topicsHome OfficeRefugees and asylum seekers"

Obviously we need to look through some of the detail.""He added that, two decades on from the row over New Labour's physical ID card scheme, the public was likely to ""look differently"" at a digital-based scheme.He did not confirm whether any new digital ID scheme would be mandatory.By law, employers have to check that prospective candidates have the right to work in the UK.Since 2022, they have been able to carry out checks on passport-holding British and Irish citizens by using digital verification services that have been certified by the government.A Home Office online scheme also exists to verify the status of some non-British or Irish citizens, whose immigration status is held electronically.It is understood officials are looking at whether requiring a digital ID could provide a more consistent approach to verifying identity.They are also thought to be exploring whether the scheme could reduce the use of fake documents, and make it easier to target enforcement activity.Estonia visitSir Keir's comments are the most positive remarks yet by the prime minister about the idea, which is likely to reignite a debate over civil liberties.Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden has visited Estonia recently to examine the Baltic state's extensive use of digital identity to allow citizens to access government and some private services such as medical records, voting and banking.The government haspreviously rejecteda digital ID proposal suggested by former Labour Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair, whose government introduced plastic ID cards in the late 2000s.Legislation to introduce the scheme was the subject of bitter clashes in the House of Lords, and plans to make them compulsory for UK citizens was later dropped.Around 15,000 entered circulation but the scheme was scrapped, and database destroyed, by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in 2011.Asked for the Tory position on digital ID, leader Kemi Badenoch said it would not help the government fulfil its pledge ""smash the gangs or stop the boats"".""A lot of people who come to the country end up disappearing into the grey economy, or the black economy. and working illegally,"" she added.""Digital ID cards would not fix that.""Checks extendedThere are sanctions including fines of up to Â£60,000 per unauthorised worker in cases where foreign workers are found to be working illegally.For agency workers, the responsibility lies with the agency to conduct the relevant checks.In March, the government announced the requirement to conduct a testwould be extendedto self-employed contractors carrying out work on behalf of a company.Currently, firms are responsible for conducting checks on such workers only if they have sponsored the visa allowing them to work in the UK.Home Secretary Yvette Cooper argued the extension would help enforcement in the so-called gig economy, where many workers are employed in temporary or casual roles.In July, French President Emmanuel Macron said the UK had agreed to address the ""fight against illegal work"" as part of pull factors attracting illegal migrants.The government has also been under pressure to find alternative living arrangements for around 32,000 asylum seekers currently living in taxpayer-funded hotels whilst their claims are processed.Ministers have promised to stop using hotels to house asylum seekers by the time of the next election, due by 2029.Sir Keir said he had asked officials at the Home Office and Ministry of Defence to ""work at pace"" to identify military sites that could be used to provide alternative accommodation.Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletterto keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.Related topicsKeir Starmer"

Some had breached visa conditions while others didn't have working rights.Immigration Enforcement director Eddy Montgomery said there were many cases where people travelling to the UK were ""sold a lie by smuggling gangs that they will be able to live and work freely in the UK.""In reality, they often end up facing squalid living conditions, minimal pay and inhumane working hours,"" he said.Dame Angela Eagle, the minister for border security and asylum, said the government would ""continue to root out unscrupulous employers and disrupt illegal workers who undermine our border security"".The government said it had also returned nearly 30,000 people over the past year who did not have the right to be in the UK.It has said it is cracking down on illegal migration, setting out its plans in a White Paper to tighten work visas and those overstaying. It scrapped a special visa for care workers introduced during the pandemic, noting that this had been a pathway exploited by some.There was mixed reaction to the plans, with some business sectors decrying the restrictions on work visas, while some Conservative opponents said the reforms didn't go far enough to stop illegal migration.The most recent data shows that approximately 44,000 people have entered the UK illegally in the year to March 2025, more than 80% through small boat journeys.Related topicsMigration"

Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp has called it a ""weak bill that won't stop the boats"".Vape shops in Cheshire and a grocery warehouse in south London were among the places raided.Those arrested made the journey to the UK through a mix of routes, including by crossing the Channel and by overstaying legitimately-granted visas.Despite having won a landslide election victory seven months ago, senior Labour strategists are already increasingly worried about losing voters concerned about immigration to Reform come the next election.Chris Mason's analysis: Ministers want to show toughness on immigrationParty figures believe that merely describing the arrests and deportations is not enough â hence the decision to release footage today of them taking place, allowing people to see with their own eyes.But there are others in the Labour Party who fear that focusing on illegal immigration only increases the salience of an issue where they could never and would never want to adopt as hardline an approach as Reform.Some Labour MPs, particularly on the left of the party, believe the government should do more to establish safe and legal routes for people to come to the UK and talk about the benefits of immigration.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Dame Angela was asked if releasing footage of the raids aligned with Sir Keir Starmer's previous pledge to create an immigration system ""based on compassion and dignity"".""I don't believe for one minute that enforcing the law and ensuring that people who break the law face the consequences of doing that, up to and including deportation, arrest, is not compassionate,"" she said.She added that it is ""important that we show what we are doing and it's important that we send messages to people who may have been sold lies about what will await them in the UK if they get themselves smuggled in"".The government also intends to reduce the number of hotels housing asylum seekers, Dame Angela said.Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Monday, she said there were plans to close nine of the 218 hotels currently in use by the end of March.Car washes and beauty sector to be targeted over immigrationPublished21 July 2024Illegal nail bar jobs offered despite clampdownPublished20 December 2024From the start of the Labour government in July up to 31 January, 3,930 arrests were made over 5,424 visits by immigration enforcement officers, the Home Office said.A total of 1,090 civil penalty notices were also issued, with employers facing a fine of up to Â£60,000 per worker if found liable.During the same period, four of the ""biggest return flights in the UK's history"" were also carried out, the Home Office said, returning more than 800 people.But Reform UK leader Nigel Farage described the new figures released by the government as feeble, compared with the numbers that had entered the country.Across the 31 days of January, there were 1,098 people who arrived in the UK illegally on small boats.The government said it launched a social media campaign in Vietnam in December and Albania in January discouraging people from making the journey to the UK.The adverts highlight stories from migrants who entered the UK illegally ""only to face debt, exploitation and a life far from what they were promised"", the Home Office said.Dame Angela said this campaign was introduced to counter ""quite sophisticated ads"" placed online by people smugglers, which ""tell lies about the situation in Britain, about how easy it is to get jobs"".People who come to the UK illegally are ""more likely to be living in squalid conditions, being exploited by vicious gangs"", she said.Later, the government's Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill will be debated in the House of Commons in its second reading.The bill aims to introduce a raft of new offences and counter terrorism-style powers to clamp down on people smugglers bringing migrants across the Channel.But Labour ministers have not provided a specific target on when a drop in small boat crossings could be expected.The Conservatives said they had put forward an amendment to the immigration bill in a bid to include their own immigration proposals: to double how long it takes migrants to get indefinite leave to remain and, after that, require them to wait five years rather than one before they can apply for citizenship.Philp added that ""an effective removals deterrent is needed"" to stop small boat crossings, something he said Labour had scrapped, a reference to the former government's plan to send illegal migrants to Rwanda.Get in touchYour Voice: What story do you want BBC News to cover?Contact formContact formRelated topicsEnglish ChannelYvette CooperMigration"

""They can hire and fire their own employees.""In court the government argued OPM asked, not ordered, the agencies to fire these employees.They also argued that probationary employees are not guaranteed employment and that only the highest performing and mission-critical employees should be hired.Government workers have been the target of the Trump administration's efforts to reduce the federal workforce in the name of cutting costs.Many employees affected by the firings are probationary employees - usually those in their first or second year in a job - though they can sometimes be long-time employees who were recently promoted.There are some 200,000 probationary employees in the federal workforce.Judge Alsup ordered OPM to revoke its directives to multiples agencies - including the Department of Veterans Affairs, the National Park Service, and the Defence Department - to terminate employees.He issued a temporary restraining order which puts a momentary pause on the government's actions until a judge revisits the matter in the coming weeks.The case began after a coalition of labour unions and non-profit organisations sued the government, arguing OPM unlawfully fired individuals by falsely claiming workers were performing poorly.Everett Kelley, the National President of the American Federation of Government Employees, called the ruling a victory for Americans were were ""illegally fired"" from their jobs by an agency with ""no authority to do so"".""These are rank-and-file workers who joined the federal government to make a difference in their communities, only to be suddenly terminated due to this administration's disdain for federal employees and desire to privatize their work,"" he said.OPM declined the BBC's request for comment.Related topicsUS governmentDonald TrumpUnited StatesMore on this storyHundreds in US climate agency fired in latest cutsPublished28 FebruaryTens of thousands of federal workers accept Trump resignation offerPublished6 FebruaryFederal workers left confused as Musk doubles down on threatPublished25 FebruaryKey US agencies tell staff not to answer Musk email on what they did last weekPublished25 February"

And, she said, many of the individuals in most need of help to challenge illegal practices are those least likely to use ETs.Young people are disproportionately subjected to unlawful working practises, but make fewer ET applications than any other age group.In contrast, managerial staff are least likely to be subject to labour market abuse, but are among the most likely to be make tribunal claims.The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it is committed to enforcing workplace regulations and tackling firms that break the rules, and is consulting on bringing agencies together under its proposed Single Enforcement Body.""We are extending state enforcement to cover holiday pay for vulnerable workers, as part of the largest upgrade to workers' rights in a generation,"" said a spokesman.However, Shadow business minister Laura Pidcock said she recognised many people worked in illegal conditions, but insisted ""the Tories are on the side of the few, not the many"".""Behind these statistics are many hours of stressful and exhausting work, people's home lives being made so much harder than they need to be, an unchecked class of bad bosses and legions of workers who feel like they have no choice but to accept illegal poor conditions,"" she said.Have you not had access to legal paid holiday?

Every single day counts, especially because I have to pay the monthly rental to keep the shop.""ClashesOn 4 November, the Saudi authorities started rounding up and deporting foreigners who were working illegally in the Gulf kingdom, as part of a campaign to enforce new labour laws.The clampdown has made it harder for some businesses to operate.Image source,ReutersImage caption,Thousands turned themselves in voluntarily, some with luggage in handDozens of shops and restaurants across the country were forced to close as illegal migrants went into hiding or returned to their home countries to avoid being arrested or prosecuted.Labour ministry officials say as many as 60,000 foreigners who had been violating the residence and employment regulations have so far been deported.The start of the campaign triggered riots in some of deprived areas of Riyadh, with several Africans reportedly killed in clashes with police.In the holy city of Mecca - some 875km (545 miles) west of the capital - 6,000 street cleaners went on strike for five days to protest against harassment by the immigration authorities as well as non-payment of wages and poor working conditions.The cleaners, most of whom are from Bangladesh, only ended their strike after their Saudi employer agreed to renew their contracts and legalise their status.StigmaMr Qeithy's problems have been compounded by the corresponding sharp rise in wages sought by the foreigners working legally in the country. Demand is suddenly far outstripping supply.Furthermore, it costs about four or five times more to employ fellow Saudis, many of whom are unwilling to do jobs seen by the majority as menial, such as cleaning and shop-keeping.""They would not accept 2,000 riyals ($533; Â£327) a month,"" Mr Qeithy says. ""A friend told me he would not take the job even if he was offered 7,000 riyals.""Image source,AFPImage caption,The crackdown is meant to lower the kingdom's unemployment rateIn recent years, laws have been toughened in an attempt to regulate Saudi Arabia's estimated nine million foreign workers, who make up about a third of its population.""The overwhelming majority, which is about seven million, are working legally in the kingdom,"" Adnan Mandora, the secretary general of Jeddah's chamber of commerce, told the BBC.""However, we have to admit that we were taken unawares by the massive figure of two million illegal migrant workers, who created a black market.""Mr Mandora rejects accusations that the government is being impatient and reckless.""The new measures actually came into force in December 2012, but we put them on hold after the turmoil created by deporting tens of thousands of such workers,"" he says.""Then, King Abdullah issued a decree to grant all private companies and businesses operating in the kingdom up to seven months to put their illegal workforce in order. That ultimatum, which expired in July, was followed by a four-month notice to either leave the country or face arrest and deportation.""UnemploymentThe main aim of the crackdown has been to create new jobs for Saudi citizens.The official unemployment rate hovers around 12%, perhaps surprisingly for an oil-rich country that is considered to have one of the strongest economies in the Arab world. Unemployment among the young is believed to be twice as high.The government has also begun imposing penalties on companies whose workforces do not include a certain percentage of Saudi nationals. It has also imposed a ban on foreigners in some professions and restrictions on firms that supply imported labour.Image source,AFPImage caption,Nearly half of those detained and then deported have been womenOther Gulf states have introduced similarly tough legislation in recent years in an attempt to reduce their reliance on foreign workers.Some argue that the Saudi authorities are partly to blame for having helped create a parallel labour market that operates on the wrong side of the law.""Red tape, the expensive process to get expatriates, and the limited quotas of visas for foreign workers that are largely secured by well-connected companies, have all contributed to creating this world of clandestine workers,"" says Hassan al-Sobhi, an economist and journalist at the al-Madina newspaper.Mr Sobhi says the illegal migrants have also been victims of violations of the visa-sponsorship system used in several Gulf states, which requires immigrants to be employed by a kafil, or sponsor, which could be an individual or a company.""Greedy and corrupt sponsors should be held accountable for selling visas to brokers, who in turn take charge of foreign workers and impose a monthly levy on their salaries. The illegal levy continues after their visas expire in return for not reporting them to the authorities,"" he adds.The system gives the kafil the right to cancel the contract with a migrant worker at any time, and there is no way of challenging such a decision through official channels.VoidThe crackdown on illegal workers has sparked a heated debate both on the streets of Saudi Arabia and on social media networks.""It will have a positive effect on our country security-wise, socially and economically. It is also a historical opportunity for the sons of our country to replace the illegal workers,"" Khalid al-Ammar wrote on Twitter.But his compatriot, Abu Azouz el-Shamail, argued that Saudis would not be able to fill the void created by the exodus of migrant workers, skilled or unskilled.""The government will deport 100,000 workers and two million will come in to replace them.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23535938,Two-thirds of fines for illegal workers uncollected,2013-08-01T12:44:03.000Z,"Two-thirds of fines for illegal workers uncollectedPublished1 August 2013Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage caption,Illegal working operation: A previous raid in LondonByDominic CascianiHome affairs correspondent, BBC NewsTwo-thirds of fines imposed on employers of illegal workers have been uncollected in the past five years, the BBC has learnt.A Freedom of Information request found the Home Office had issued almost Â£80m in fines but collected Â£25m.Restaurants and take-aways incurred the most fines - more than Â£55m.Meanwhile, immigration enforcement officers have been taking part in 200 raids and have arrested 101 suspected illegal immigrants across the country.The Home Office has been running the major illegal workers crackdown.The data on fines collected by BBC News relates to the civil penalty system through which the Home Office can fine an employer up to Â£10,000 if they are found to have an illegal immigrant on their books.The figures show that more than 8,500 penalties totalling Â£79,300,000 were issued between 2008/09 and 2012/13, but two-thirds of that total remains uncollected.In the first year that the fines system was in operation, there were Â£16.7m in fines - but only Â£1.3m of that was collected. Since then, the amount collected has increased to more than Â£6m a year.The businesses that have received the most penalties include restaurants, take-aways, car washes, factories, food producers and small shops. More than 150 supermarkets were also fined for having illegal workers.In its response to the BBC's FOI request, the Home Office said some of the original fines may have been reduced or cancelled after appeals. Some employers may have also gone out of business - while others could have asked to pay in instalments.A Home Office spokesman said: ""The government is determined to take effective action to reduce illegal migration, and to tackle illegal working. Giving employers hefty fines if they employ illegal immigrants is a key part of this.""As part of our upcoming Immigration Bill, we will take even tougher action against businesses which use illegal labour and will double the fines levied against rogue employers. The Bill will also strengthen our ability to enforce unpaid fines.""In the last financial year, there were more than 5,000 illegal workers operations resulting in some 4,500 arrests.Speaking about Thursday's enforcement operations, immigration minister Mark Harper said: ""Today's arrests highlight the routine work we are carrying out every day to stamp out illegal working.""We are sending a clear message to employers who choose to use illegal labour: we will find you and you will pay a heavy penalty.""Illegal working undercuts legitimate businesses and is often linked to exploitative behaviour such as tax evasion and harmful working conditions. We will not allow the growth of a shadow economy for illegal migrants.""FOI data conducted by BBC Researcher Laura Francis."
