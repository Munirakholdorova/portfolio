Out of the six staff there, five were found not to have any right to work in the UK, the spokesman said.

Four men from Bangladesh were detained, pending removal from the UK, for overstaying their visas.

A fifth man, who had an outstanding immigration case, was escorted from the building and will have to report to the Home Office pending a decision on his case.

Paul Smith, from the Surrey immigration enforcement team, said: ""This is the latest in a series of operations targeting illegal working in Surrey and more are planned.

""Where we find people living and working illegally in the UK we will seek to remove them."""

Two Bangladeshi men who had illegally entered the UK were found at the Saffron Lounge restaurant on Main Road.

Two failed Vietnamese asylum seekers - a man and woman - were caught at The Lounge Nail Bar on St Mary's Street, along with a male illegal immigrant.

Both firms were issued with spot fines after the raids at the end of March.

Between 1 April 2010 and 31 March 2011 the agency found 73 illegal workers at 39 businesses across Lincolnshire."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23535938,Two-thirds of fines for illegal workers uncollected,2013,"Two-thirds of fines imposed on employers of illegal workers have been uncollected in the past five years, the BBC has learnt.

A Freedom of Information request found the Home Office had issued almost Â£80m in fines but collected Â£25m.

Restaurants and take-aways incurred the most fines - more than Â£55m.

Meanwhile, immigration enforcement officers have been taking part in 200 raids and have arrested 101 suspected illegal immigrants across the country.

The Home Office has been running the major illegal workers crackdown.

The data on fines collected by BBC News relates to the civil penalty system through which the Home Office can fine an employer up to Â£10,000 if they are found to have an illegal immigrant on their books.

The figures show that more than 8,500 penalties totalling Â£79,300,000 were issued between 2008/09 and 2012/13, but two-thirds of that total remains uncollected.

In the first year that the fines system was in operation, there were Â£16.7m in fines - but only Â£1.3m of that was collected. Since then, the amount collected has increased to more than Â£6m a year.

The businesses that have received the most penalties include restaurants, take-aways, car washes, factories, food producers and small shops. More than 150 supermarkets were also fined for having illegal workers.

In its response to the BBC's FOI request, the Home Office said some of the original fines may have been reduced or cancelled after appeals. Some employers may have also gone out of business - while others could have asked to pay in instalments.

A Home Office spokesman said: ""The government is determined to take effective action to reduce illegal migration, and to tackle illegal working. Giving employers hefty fines if they employ illegal immigrants is a key part of this.

""As part of our upcoming Immigration Bill, we will take even tougher action against businesses which use illegal labour and will double the fines levied against rogue employers. The Bill will also strengthen our ability to enforce unpaid fines.""

In the last financial year, there were more than 5,000 illegal workers operations resulting in some 4,500 arrests.

Speaking about Thursday's enforcement operations, immigration minister Mark Harper said: ""Today's arrests highlight the routine work we are carrying out every day to stamp out illegal working.

""We are sending a clear message to employers who choose to use illegal labour: we will find you and you will pay a heavy penalty.

""Illegal working undercuts legitimate businesses and is often linked to exploitative behaviour such as tax evasion and harmful working conditions. We will not allow the growth of a shadow economy for illegal migrants.""

The discovery was made during a raid by UK Border Agency staff on the Nibana Restaurant in Crownhill, Plymouth, on Tuesday evening.

The illegal workers are an 18-year-old Iranian man and three Bangladeshi men, aged 22, 24 and 27.

The operation was part of planned nationwide action to tackle illegal working, sham marriages, bogus colleges and organised immigration crime.

After checking the immigration status of staff, three men were found to have no right to work in the UK.

They have immigration applications currently being processed, but do not have permission to work.

If these applications are turned down, the men will be deported.

One of the men told officers he had permission to work in the UK and initial checks indicated this was the case, but it emerged that his visa had expired in July and he was therefore in the UK illegally.

Officers returned to the restaurant on Wednesday and arrested the 24-year-old Bangladeshi.

He and the 27-year-old man are both being held in immigration detention pending their removal from the UK.

The restaurant was given a civil penalty notice warning the employer a fine of up to Â£40,000 - Â£10,000 per illegal worker - will be imposed unless proof is provided that right-to-work checks were carried out on the men.

Immigration Minister Damian Green said: ""We are determined to make it harder than ever for illegal immigrants to come to the UK.

""Illegal immigration puts pressure on public services, local communities and legitimate businesses at a time when this country cannot afford it."""

The UK Border Agency raided restaurants where it was suspected they were using illegal workers.

Two Bangladeshi men were arrested at the Bengal Lounge on Princess Avenue and a Chinese man was arrested at The Great Wall on Newstead Street.

Two men have been detained for deportation. The restaurants were fined Â£10,000 for each illegal worker.

A 31-year-old Bangladeshi man was detained for deportation after his visa was found to have expired.

A 22-year-old was arrested for not having permission to work and released on bail.

The Chinese man, 30, suspected of entering the UK illegally was arrested and detained while plans are made to send him home.

Alison Hardie, from the UK Border Agency said: ""It is vital for businesses taking on foreign staff to ensure that they have permission to work.

""Employers who ignore their responsibilities and do not make the necessary checks are taking jobs away from those entitled to work and face serious financial penalties.""

In 2010 more than 1,350 people were returned to their home countries from across Yorkshire and the Humber region for working illegally."

The UK Border Agency said the men, all from India, were employed by a sub contractor and had no legal right to work in the UK.

It said the sub-contractor had been served with a civil penalty notice for employing illegal workers.

The site has been the scene of demonstrations by people demanding jobs be given to British workers.

The border agency said acting on information its officers and Dyfed-Powys Police went to the power station early on Thursday.

Eleven of those held remain in immigration detention pending deportation.

Sixteen have been placed on immigration bail while the border agency secures the emergency travel documents necessary to deport them.

One man has been arrested by police on suspicion of using a false identity document.

Julian Smith, head of the border agency's south west Wales immigration team, said if their employer was unable to prove right-to-work checks were carried out a fine of up to Â£10,000 would be imposed for each worker.

""This was a very complex operation which involved questioning 51 workers and carrying out searches of five residential addresses,"" he said.

""It was by far the biggest illegal working operation in Wales this year.

""I hope this sends out a message to other employers that you need to ensure your staff are entitled to work in the UK.

""We don't expect employers to be experts at detecting forgeries - that's our job - but there is a legal obligation to carry out basic checks during the recruitment process.

""Illegal immigration takes employment away from the resident labour market.

""There are strict controls on the numbers of foreign nationals that can come to the UK in search of work.""

Immigration Minister Damian Green said: ""This operation is among many being carried out across the country following the success of a major crackdown on immigration crime during the summer, which generated a large number of arrests, cash seizures and prosecutions as well as fresh intelligence.

""Illegal immigration puts huge pressure on the public purse at a time when the country can least afford it.

""Together with the police and the Serious Organised Crime Agency we will continue to make life as difficult as possible for those who cheat the immigration system.""

Once completed the power station, which will be run by RWE npower, will be the largest of its kind in Wales.

There are around 1,500 construction staff working on the plant."

Edris Ali hired two illegal workers at the Tasty pizza restaurant in Hartlepool and another four at Bubbles Car Valeting in Guisborough.

They were discovered during Immigration Enforcement visits in 2020 and 2022.

Dave Magrath, from the Insolvency Agency, said Ali ""failed in his statutory duties by employing these six people who did not have the right to work in the UK"".

""Employers hiring illegal workers defrauds the public purse and puts potentially vulnerable people at risk of exploitation,"" he added.

Immigration Enforcement visited the restaurant in January 2020 and found two Iranian men in their 30s working illegally.

In October 2022, a visit to the hand car wash found four men in their 20s from Iran, Sudan and Ivory Coast working at the site.

Ali, 39, of Lorne Street, Middlesbrough, had been working as a director at the two companies in 2019 but resigned in 2022.

After the discovery, Hama Tasty Ltd was fined Â£20,000, while Bubbles Car Valeting was handed a Â£60,000 fine for the immigration breaches.

Ali was given a disqualification order at the High Court in London last month, and  the 10-year ban came into force on Tuesday.

The ban prevents him from being involved in the promotion, formation or management of a company without the permission of the court.

He was also ordered to pay Â£9,884 in costs.

The Home Office's Theresa Gregory said: ""Employers have a responsibility to carry out thorough checks on individuals prior to employment to ensure they have the right to work in the UK.

""A failure to do so may lead to further action being taken by the regulator.""

Immigration Enforcement fined the business Â£20,000 after they raided the premises in 2020.

The business went into liquidation in March 2022.

Kevin Read, chief investigator at the Insolvency Service, said: âDonduâ¯Ozmiccoâsâ¯failureâ¯toâ¯ensureâ¯theâ¯requiredâ¯right-to-work checks were carried out led to the employment of two illegal workers, in contravention of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

âThis represents a serious breach of legislation and of the standards expected of company directors.""

Ms Ozmicco, of Scale Hall Lane, Lancaster, was the sole director of Flames Pizzeria â NM Catering Ltd, from its formation in December 2019 until it entered liquidation in March 2022.

The pizzeria was visited by officers from Immigration Enforcement in October 2020 and the company was found to be employing two illegal workers.

Aâ¯civilâ¯penaltyâ¯ofâ¯Â£20,000â¯wasâ¯issuedâ¯by Immigration Enforcement in March 2021 which remained unpaid at liquidation.

One of the workers said he had worked at the premises for between one and two weeks.

HM Inspector Kendal Barnett, Home Office Immigration Enforcement said: âIllegal working cheats honest workers out of employment, puts vulnerable people at risk, and defrauds the public purse.

âWe will continue to work with partners including the Insolvency Service, as well as law enforcement agencies to tackle illegal migration in all its forms.â

The Secretary of State for Business and Trade accepted a disqualification undertaking from Ms Ozmicco, and her six-year ban began on 10 January.

The Federation of Small Businesses said its members did not have the necessary expertise of resources to carry out the necessary checks on staff.

Roger House, from the federation, said: ""If a business has an HR department then it can probably cope.

""For the small business it just adds that extra layer of bureaucracy and a penalty if they get it wrong.""

""We acknowledge we didnât manage it well and we want to take responsibility for that.""

Ms Thuy Nguyen told the hearing that it was part of their culture to help provide food and shelter for people in need and they did not wilfully employ anyone without the correct paperwork.

Both restaurants had their licences reviewed and revoked by Darlington Borough Council.

Licensing committee chair Sonia Kane told Mr Wu and Ms Thuy Nguyen: ""We donât feel you are fit and proper people to run a restaurant.""

""This operation was a huge success and I thank our officers who executed it expertly"".

The Home Office said the operation at the former paper mill where the workers were arrested was launched in response to concerns raised by the public.

Shotton Mill is being converted to a containerboard factory.

The 13 people arrested were working as subcontracted labourers and steel-fixers.  The Home Office said they would now be removed from the UK.

Both companies were issued with civil penalty referral notices, pending a review of evidence from the site visit and company records.

Under the civil penalty process, a referral notice is issued if officials determine they have found illegal workers and there is no statutory excuse for employing them.

At that stage the company can provide further evidence that it wants to be taken into account when determining liability and the level of any penalty.

The civil penalty can also be challenged in court. Fines for employing illegal workers were significantly increased in February.

The maximum civil penalty for a first breach increased from Â£15,000 a worker to Â£45,000 a worker.

""[That] is prohibited on the visas that these individuals currently hold.""

Later the Home Office confirmed five males from India had been arrested, with a woman from the same nation held after a follow-up house search.

It added that of the five males, one was a student working in breach of rules and two were ""student overstayers"".

The firm was served with a civil penalty notice for a total potential fine of up to Â£100,000, the Home Office said.

There were also visits to two car washes in the city and a construction site.

In total, 12 arrests were made and there was ""a total civil penalty liability of Â£180,000"".

The 50-year-old man, from Nigeria, was escorted from the construction site in Central Park, Newton Heath.

The UK Border Agency (UKBA) said the man was held for immigration offences and must now report to the local enforcement office.

GMP said it was in discussions with the contractor over the suspected breach.

The new headquarters, which will replace the force's current Trafford base, is expected to house more than 1,000 staff.

Construction work is continuing ahead of its scheduled opening next summer.

A 50-year-old man, who was caught working at Metrolink in Pollard Street, despite his visa being out of date, was also arrested during the police and UK Border Agency operation.

He was put on a flight back to Pakistan.

The contractor which employed the men could now face a fine of up to Â£10,000 per worker unless it can demonstrate the correct checks were carried out.

A police spokesman said: ""GMP has been made aware of a breach of contract with a firm providing security for the new force headquarters site.

Three workers from the Philippines were working at a care home in Torquay, and a Chinese woman was found working in a restaurant in the town.

Three men, two from Pakistan and one from India, were working at a shop in Paignton in breach of student visas.

The agency said the men from Pakistan and India were waiting to be deported, and the four women were on bail."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-35104939,Pair guilty of employing illegal workers on phone accessory stalls,2015,"Two men who employed illegal workers on their mobile phone accessory stalls have been given suspended sentences.

Shakir Ullah, 35, is a director of Digital Circle Ltd, and Irfan Ali, 32, runs a company called Simply Peach.

In the first such case in Northern Ireland, they both pleaded guilty to five charges of facilitating unlawful entry to the UK.

The charges stemmed from Home Office raids on their stalls in 19 shopping centres in Northern Ireland.

Eleven illegal workers were discovered during the raids almost two years ago.

They were subsequently removed to the countries they had come from; in this case, Pakistan or India, while a prosecution was begun against their employers.

Both men, who are originally from Pakistan, run a number of businesses based in Manchester.

Carolyne Lindsay, of Immigration Enforcement's crime team, said: ""This case reinforces the message about our commitment to tackling those responsible for bringing illegal immigrants to the UK.

""Not only did Ullah and Ali knowingly try to flout immigration laws, they also preyed on vulnerable people desperate to reach the UK.""

That was a message echoed by the prosecution after the two men pleaded guilty.

A defence lawyer, however, said the pair did not accept that they had exploited any of the workers.

He said they had all applied for the jobs and been paid fairly, and there was no suggestion of people trafficking.

The judge accepted that this was the case and both men were spared jail, with suspended sentences of 18 months for Ali and three years for Ullah.

Assets have also been seized from the men's companies under the Proceeds of Crime Act.

This includes some Â£140,000 which is currently frozen.

A separate team of Home Office financial investigators will pursue this money and other assets through civil courts."

The bill, to be introduced in the autumn, will also contain measures against takeaway restaurants and off-licences which employ illegal migrants.

Penalties will also include an unlimited fine and wages being seized.

Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said the government ""would continue to crack down on abuse"" of the system.

The government has made a series of immigration announcements over the summer of which this is the latest.

Takeaways and off-licences could lose their licences if they were found to be employing illegal workers.

Officials are also considering whether this provision should be extended to cover minicab drivers and operators.

The legal defence for other kinds of business discovered using illegal workers will also change.

They will no longer be able to claim they did not know a particular employee was not allowed to work - they will have to show that they carried out proper checks before taking them on.

The maximum sentence for employers found guilty will be raised from two to five years, in addition to the fines already in force.

Mr Brokenshire said: ""Anyone who thinks the UK is a soft touch should be in no doubt - if you are here illegally, we will take action to stop you from working, renting a flat, opening a bank account or driving a car.

""As a one nation government we will continue to crack down on abuse and build an immigration system that works in the best interests of the British people and those who play by the rules.""

Alp Mehmet, of Migration Watch UK, which supports tighter immigration controls, said: ""This is not just about not being seen as a soft touch.

""More important is for the message to go out that if you are here illegally and caught working, you and your employer will end up in court.

""Let us hope that the authorities will not shy away from acting on the powers they are to be given, since their record on that front has not always been exemplary.""

Earlier this month, the government also announced thatlandlords in England will be expected to evict tenantswho lose the right to live in the UK, also under the proposed Immigration Bill.

Landlords will be able to end tenancies, sometimes without a court order, when asylum requests fail, and will be required to check a migrant's status in advance of agreeing a lease. Repeat offenders could face up to five years in prison.

And Mr Brokenshire has previously said businesses that employ illegal workers will be hit with""the full force of government machinery"".

The Home Office visited Kaaizan's in Longsands Parade, St Neots, Cambridgeshire, in June, and found three men working illegally, who were subsequently arrested.

It alerted Huntingdonshire District Council who reviewed the Indian restaurant's licence.

Cambridgeshire Constabulary told the council's licencing committee meeting on Wednesday that it was concerned about possible modern slavery at the establishment.

In a statement to the committee, Det Sgt Chris Acourt said the men were living and working at the restaurant and had no contracts of employment, which he described as a modern slavery ""red flag"".

In his statement he said: ""Based on the report provided it shows that the three individuals highlighted both work and sleep at the restaurant.

""This would be a modern slavery red flag due to the concerns about whether the highlighted individuals had any choice about where they live or if it was a condition of their employment.""

The licensing committee decided to suspend the licence for three months, which is the maximum length of time it could order.

The committee's record of decision, which was published shortly after the meeting, said the committee decided to suspend the licence - rather than revoke it - as the business was in the process of being sold.

However, any new owner would have to ensure there were ""robust right-to-work checks"" in the future.

Three people who had been working illegally at Posh Spice in June 2022 were found to still be at the restaurant during a raid in February.

Immigration Enforcement called for a review of the Nailsea restaurant.

On Monday, North Somerset Council revoked the restaurant's licence to serve alcohol and late-night food.

The licensing subcommittee meeting had earlier been suspended for more than an hour as staff tried to get in touch with immigration officials after they failed to attend.

Jasmine Miah, the daughter of licence holder Golap Miah, said the wait had left her father feeling anxious.

Speaking while waiting for the meeting to resume, she said: ""I don't want any pressure on him, whatever the outcome.""

The meeting resumed with Jonathan Watson of Immigration Enforcement joining by video link.

Mr Watson confirmed that none of the three individuals had the right to work at the restaurant at the time of the February raid, although one had been granted it three weeks later.

Another individual had previously been allowed to work for 20 hours a week as a student, but this had been revoked as he was not enrolled to study.

The other had the right to work in some professions, where there were shortages of workers, but not at a restaurant.

Posh Spice will no longer be able to sell alcohol or serve hot food after 23:00.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49710817,Illegal work practices 'far too common' says think tank study,2019,"About one in 20 workers does not get paid holidays, while one in 10 does not get a payslip, according to a report by the Resolution Foundation think tank.

It found workers over the age of 65 are most likely to not have paid holidays, despite a legal entitlement to 28 days a year, or pro-rota for part-timers.

And workers aged 25 and under are twice as likely to be underpaid the minimum wage that any other age group.

The think tank says its findings reveal the extent of illegal labour practices.

Workers in hotels and restaurants miss out out more than others on legal workplace entitlements, the report says.

Meanwhile, those in small firms, employing fewer than 25, are most likely to not get payslips and paid leave, as are workers on zero-hours and temporary contracts, the Resolution Foundation said.

The analysis was published to mark the start of the organisation's three-year investigation into the enforcement of labour market rules and regulations.

Lindsay Judge, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""The UK has a multitude of rules to govern its labour market, from maximum hours to minimum pay, but these rules can only become a reality if they are properly enforced.

""Labour market violations remain far too common, with millions of workers missing out on basic entitlements to a payslip, holiday entitlement and the minimum wage.

""Our analysis suggests that, while violations take place across the labour market, the government should also prioritise investigations into sectors like hotels and restaurants, along with firms who make large use of atypical employment contracts, as that's where abuse is most prevalent,"" Ms Judge said.

She welcomed the government's move to strengthen the resources and powers of bodies such as HM Revenue & Customs and the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Agency.

However, the UK still largely relies on individuals seeking redress through the Employment Tribunal (ET) system. And, she said, many of the individuals in most need of help to challenge illegal practices are those least likely to use ETs.

Young people are disproportionately subjected to unlawful working practises, but make fewer ET applications than any other age group.

In contrast, managerial staff are least likely to be subject to labour market abuse, but are among the most likely to be make tribunal claims.

The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it is committed to enforcing workplace regulations and tackling firms that break the rules, and is consulting on bringing agencies together under its proposed Single Enforcement Body.

""We are extending state enforcement to cover holiday pay for vulnerable workers, as part of the largest upgrade to workers' rights in a generation,"" said a spokesman.

However, Shadow business minister Laura Pidcock said she recognised many people worked in illegal conditions, but insisted ""the Tories are on the side of the few, not the many"".

""Behind these statistics are many hours of stressful and exhausting work, people's home lives being made so much harder than they need to be, an unchecked class of bad bosses and legions of workers who feel like they have no choice but to accept illegal poor conditions,"" she said.

In March, the Gulf state said that those without papers would not be arrested if they left within 90 days.

The deadline wasextended by another month, but so far only 60,000 out of an estimated 400,000 Ethiopians have left, the Ethiopian government says.

Ethiopians make up a large portion of the kingdom's undocumented workers.

All those without papers now face imprisonment or forced deportation.

Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories

Ethiopia's Communications Minister Negeri Lencho told the BBC he feared what could now happen to his compatriots who were still in Saudi Arabia, adding they must return ""with a sense of urgency"".

""They will be imprisoned and we don't want our citizens to face unnecessary imprisonment, or suffer any physical harm or humiliation,"" Mr Lencho said.

One of those who returned is 28-year-old domestic worker Nura Ahmed. ""Life was really tough,"" she told the BBC's Emmanuel Igunza just after she arrived in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa.

""Sometimes I was jobless because I did not have the proper documentation, so I had no freedom to move around.

""One can never be at peace there,"" she added.

In 2013, a number of Ethiopians died in clashes with Saudi police as they were being rounded up for deportation.

Saudi Arabia attracts migrant workers from around the world, particularly Africa, and south and south-east Asia.

Saudi authorities estimate that up to one million people are working in the country illegally.

So far, tens of thousands of people of different nationalities have taken advantage of the grace period and have either left or acquired correct papers."

Siddique Faud Rahman, from the Chameli Indian Tandoori restaurant in Holbeach, faced a licensing committee on Tuesday.

Five of his workers were found without the correct permissions during an investigation in April.

The committee said it was not satisfied the premises would not employ illegal staff again and revoked his licence.

When he appeared before South Holland District Council's licensing committee on Tuesday Mr Rahman, denied being involved in ""modern slavery"" but told councillors: ""I'm going to put my hands up, yes, we employed illegal workers.""

He said because of the Covid lockdown his business had struggled to pay overheads and after the furlough scheme a number of his workers had not returned.

""I had to get some staff working, or I would have to close my business down,"" he said.

Mr Rahman added: ""The workers were paid above minimum wage, plus accommodation and food â¦ there was no modern day slavery. They were loved and cared for as my own family.""

The Local Democracy Reporting Servicesaid Mr Rahman told councillors: ""If this license is revoked then we will probably have to close down the business because we cannot survive.""

Sgt Lee Cotton from Lincolnshire Police, told the committee: ""I appreciate the difficulties with the furlough scheme, but responsible businesses do not employ illegal workers.

""They take the necessary steps to employ legal workers.""

Revoking the licence, the committee said the ""calculated risk"" taken by the business meant they ""could not be satisfied the premises would never resort to employing illegal workers again if it faced difficult conditions.""

Councillor Paul Redgate said: ""You keep saying you had no choice, everyone has a choice, you made the decision not to employ legal workers.""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10515357,The tax-paying illegal workers living in London,2010,"In his small two-bedroom flat, Felipe looks through a carefully filed thick pile of payslips.

They show he has been making regular tax and national insurance contributions and have been issued by a large well-known company, where he has been working for six years. Yet Felipe is an illegal immigrant with no right to work in the United Kingdom.

Professor Ian Gordon, the co-author of a report on the issue of illegal working, says that he thinks Felipe's story is far from unusual.

Prof Gordon, of the London School of Economics, told File on 4 that ""probably two-thirds"" of illegal workers are paying ""some kind of taxes and national insurance"".

""I don't think that it's the case that the great majority of irregular migrants live in and work in some entirely cut-off economy,"" he adds.

""I think that most of them are on the margins to start with and then well inside the margins of the mainstream economy with some kind of paperwork to support them.""

Some estimate that Felipe is one of about 200,000 illegal workers in London, although there could be more than that.

The UK Border Agency,externalin the South East carries out regular raids on employers. In the last financial year in the region, there were 22,714 immigration removals.

Back in his flat, Felipe produces his P60 - his annual tax statement. It shows he paid about Â£750 in national insurance over the course of a year.

Felipe, who is from Colombia and has been living in the UK illegally for nine years, claims he bought his national insurance number from a fraudster.

""I just use it as anyone else as anyone else would use his national insurance. I just hand it to my boss and fill out the forms and that's it,"" he says.

He adds: ""I see it [paying tax and national insurance] as a kind of payback for me being here. And I don't mind - and I prefer that - as long as I can work I am happy.

""The reason for me being here is not just because I want to become rich or because I want to come and take your jobs.

""I'm doing the job that most English people wouldn't do. I think I have never seen an English person cleaning a toilet.""

With tears in his eyes, he says he is doing it for his two young children and regularly sends money back to them in Colombia.

""I don't want to harm anyoneâ¦. It's hard to be judged as a criminal when all you are doing is what you think is best for your family. What I'm doing cleaning toilets - is that a crime?""

For Andrew Large, chief executive of the Cleaning and Support Services Association which represents contract cleaning companies, this is a familiar story.

""This is a problem that my members have come across on a number of occasions. It seems quite clearly that people are able to use national insurance numbers to which they have no right,"" he says.

""They may be legitimate national insurance numbers that have been misappropriated or alternatively, they may be wholly fictitious.""

Mr Large says the government needs to take responsibility.

""From our perspective, it would seem that inside Her Majesty's Revenue and Customsâ¦ there doesn't seem to be an effective process for handling any anomalies with regard to the number and the name which might emerge as part of this process. They certainly do not appear to be communicating with the UK Border Agency.""

A government statement said it was committed to stopping illegal working but added: ""It is an employer's responsibility to ensure they check their employee's paperwork to ensure they have the right to work in the UK.

""If they can't provide this proof, they will be liable for a fine of up to Â£10,000 per illegal worker.

""All government departments are working together to clamp down on illegal workers and the companies that employ them.""

After a trial at Glasgow Sheriff Court, John Nicol, 73, from Johnstone, was convicted of practising as an unregistered dentist in March 2015.

Outside court, Nicol said people came to his firm, Speedy Dentures, after ""terrible treatment from dentists"".

He said: ""It's a medal I should be getting.""

Nicol, who was registered with the General Dental Council until 2011, was caught after a private investigator arranged for a woman to carry out detective work.

In evidence Lyndsay Grant, 46, said she was to find out if dentistry work was taking place on the premises and ""if there was any fingers being inserted in to the mouth - wet work"".

She told procurator fiscal depute Mhairi Alexander she had taken her mum, who had a problem with her plate, to see Nicol - who had offered to make a new plate or to fix the current one.

Mr Grant said: ""He was keen to, in his words 'impression her up'.""

He went away to do what she thought was prepare to make impressions.

Before any ""wet work"" could take place, the women left.

Defence lawyer Gillian Barsanti had argued there was an ""absence of vital evidence"".

Sheriff Barry Divers convicted Nicol of breaching the Dentist Act 1984 by holding himself out to be a dentist while not registered as a dentist or dental care professional.

Speaking outside court Nicol said: ""It's unfair. It's a private transaction between people who choose to come to me because they've had terrible treatment from dentists.

""I don't advertise as being a dentist and some dentists even refer people to me.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25127368,Saudi crackdown on illegal workers sparks heated debate,2013,"For Abu Osama al-Qeithy, starting up a small business in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, has been difficult.

He has paid for his operators' licence and insurance, and met all the conditions set by the ministry of labour, but his fast-food outlet is still standing idle as workers have become something of a rarity.

""I applied three months ago to get visas for foreign workers and am still waiting,"" Mr Qeithy says.

""The usual government reply has been: 'Your application is still being considered.' Every single day counts, especially because I have to pay the monthly rental to keep the shop.""

On 4 November, the Saudi authorities started rounding up and deporting foreigners who were working illegally in the Gulf kingdom, as part of a campaign to enforce new labour laws.

The clampdown has made it harder for some businesses to operate.

Dozens of shops and restaurants across the country were forced to close as illegal migrants went into hiding or returned to their home countries to avoid being arrested or prosecuted.

Labour ministry officials say as many as 60,000 foreigners who had been violating the residence and employment regulations have so far been deported.

The start of the campaign triggered riots in some of deprived areas of Riyadh, with several Africans reportedly killed in clashes with police.

In the holy city of Mecca - some 875km (545 miles) west of the capital - 6,000 street cleaners went on strike for five days to protest against harassment by the immigration authorities as well as non-payment of wages and poor working conditions.

The cleaners, most of whom are from Bangladesh, only ended their strike after their Saudi employer agreed to renew their contracts and legalise their status.

Mr Qeithy's problems have been compounded by the corresponding sharp rise in wages sought by the foreigners working legally in the country. Demand is suddenly far outstripping supply.

Furthermore, it costs about four or five times more to employ fellow Saudis, many of whom are unwilling to do jobs seen by the majority as menial, such as cleaning and shop-keeping.

""They would not accept 2,000 riyals ($533; Â£327) a month,"" Mr Qeithy says. ""A friend told me he would not take the job even if he was offered 7,000 riyals.""

In recent years, laws have been toughened in an attempt to regulate Saudi Arabia's estimated nine million foreign workers, who make up about a third of its population.

""The overwhelming majority, which is about seven million, are working legally in the kingdom,"" Adnan Mandora, the secretary general of Jeddah's chamber of commerce, told the BBC.

""However, we have to admit that we were taken unawares by the massive figure of two million illegal migrant workers, who created a black market.""

Mr Mandora rejects accusations that the government is being impatient and reckless.

""The new measures actually came into force in December 2012, but we put them on hold after the turmoil created by deporting tens of thousands of such workers,"" he says.

""Then, King Abdullah issued a decree to grant all private companies and businesses operating in the kingdom up to seven months to put their illegal workforce in order. That ultimatum, which expired in July, was followed by a four-month notice to either leave the country or face arrest and deportation.""

The main aim of the crackdown has been to create new jobs for Saudi citizens.

The official unemployment rate hovers around 12%, perhaps surprisingly for an oil-rich country that is considered to have one of the strongest economies in the Arab world. Unemployment among the young is believed to be twice as high.

The government has also begun imposing penalties on companies whose workforces do not include a certain percentage of Saudi nationals. It has also imposed a ban on foreigners in some professions and restrictions on firms that supply imported labour.

Other Gulf states have introduced similarly tough legislation in recent years in an attempt to reduce their reliance on foreign workers.

Some argue that the Saudi authorities are partly to blame for having helped create a parallel labour market that operates on the wrong side of the law.

""Red tape, the expensive process to get expatriates, and the limited quotas of visas for foreign workers that are largely secured by well-connected companies, have all contributed to creating this world of clandestine workers,"" says Hassan al-Sobhi, an economist and journalist at the al-Madina newspaper.

Mr Sobhi says the illegal migrants have also been victims of violations of the visa-sponsorship system used in several Gulf states, which requires immigrants to be employed by a kafil, or sponsor, which could be an individual or a company.

""Greedy and corrupt sponsors should be held accountable for selling visas to brokers, who in turn take charge of foreign workers and impose a monthly levy on their salaries. The illegal levy continues after their visas expire in return for not reporting them to the authorities,"" he adds.

The system gives the kafil the right to cancel the contract with a migrant worker at any time, and there is no way of challenging such a decision through official channels.

The crackdown on illegal workers has sparked a heated debate both on the streets of Saudi Arabia and on social media networks.

""It will have a positive effect on our country security-wise, socially and economically. It is also a historical opportunity for the sons of our country to replace the illegal workers,"" Khalid al-Ammar wrote on Twitter.

But his compatriot, Abu Azouz el-Shamail, argued that Saudis would not be able to fill the void created by the exodus of migrant workers, skilled or unskilled.

""The government will deport 100,000 workers and two million will come in to replace them. They leave via the immigration gate and re-enter via the new workers gate,"" he explained."

Weymouth Tandoori in Maiden Street, Dorset, was raided by Home Office officials on 24 September, who said they received information that immigration offences ""were routinely being committed"" there.

After Dorset councillors reviewed the restaurant's premises licence, they said written records must be kept to show employees can legally work in the UK.

They concluded the restaurant's licence holder, Jamal Uddin, had not operated in a ""deliberate"" way to ""defraud or to exploit workers"".

Dorset Police asked for Weymouth Tandoori'spremises licence,external, which allows the sale of alcohol, to be reviewed.

Tim Munro, for Mr Uddin, said his client ""demonstrated poor administration processes rather than a deliberate attempt to flout the law"".

He said Mr Uddin had expected a firm to carry out the right-to-work checks on employees but later found out that these had not been done.

Mr Uddin then carried out some checks on one member of staff but they were ""inadequate and led to the employment of a worker who didn't have the necessary right to work in the UK in that sector"", Mr Munro added.

But Dorset Council's licensing sub-committee said revoking the restaurant's licence ""would not necessarily resolve the issues because the restaurant could continue without the sale of alcohol"".

It found it was ""clear"" that Mr Uddin was getting help ""to ensure that the business operates in a lawful way"" in the future.

Mr Uddin must ensure that right-to-work checks are carried out and that evidence of those can be inspected by a licensing officer.

Dorset Police said a report by immigration officials about the restaurant ""contains sensitive information and cannot be in the public domain"".

Koloshi Indian Restaurant on London Road had its premises licence reviewed and revoked by Cheltenham Borough Council this week.

The restaurant previously had a licence to sell alcohol every day from 09:00 to midnight.

However, the Home Office requested a review of its licence in April.

Officers visited the restaurant on 1 April and found six illegal workers, said theLocal Democracy Reporting Service.

In August, Koloshi Gold (GB) Ltd was fined Â£90.000 for employing six people who did not have the right to work in the UK.

Legal representatives for the licensee told the licensing sub-committee on 11 October he could not comment on what the Home Office representatives said in relation to the raid and the finding of illegal workers there.

""My client became the owner subsequent to that. My client didn't know about this raid until he learnt from the council about the review.""

He said they were not there to justify anything that had happened during the previous ownership.

His client has not had any issues with illegal working in 25 years of being in the industry, he said.

""He appreciates the damage that it does to the country and the people. It is a bona fide change of ownership.""

Licensing chairman David Willingham said the committee was unanimous in its decision to revoke the premises' licence.

""Six workers with immigration issues suggest complicity in providing work for trafficked individuals. This raises questions over exploitation, failure to pay national insurance and tax and national minimum wage.""

He said given the rapid sale of the business for Â£100,000 a lot more due diligence should have been undertaken.

""People related to the company Koloshi Gold are still involved with the company Three Gold.

""On balance of probabilities the committee thinks the owners and the documentation still show evidence of control by Koloshi Gold and CBS Properties Limited.

""The committee is concerned these are all interconnected with the company Three Gold.

The Home Office sought the revocation of Abdul Mannan Shabul Ali's licence.

The council was told Mr Ali had been fined Â£35,000 in 2019 for employing illegal workers at the 50-seat eatery after he showed no evidence that he made any checks on the eligibility of workers.

A Home Office immigration enforcement officer told councillors the ability to work without authorisation, as Mr Ali had allowed to happen, is a key driver of illegal migration, theLocal Democracy Reporting Service said.

The officer added: ""It encourages people to take risks in trying to enter the UK illegally by putting their lives in the hands of unscrupulous people smugglers and leaves them vulnerable to exploitative employers.""

Officers told the hearing Akbar Dynasty, which opened in 2009 in a former Little Chef premises, had been repeatedly raided by immigration officers.

During one inspection in 2019, a worker was found hiding in a toilet and another, whose hands and clothes were stained red from curry, was sitting at a table posing as a customer.

Mr Ali, who represented himself, said he had no knowledge of the 2019 raids and claimed he had taken over the restaurant the following year.

The restaurant was raided again in February 2020 with officers interviewing workers,according to a report to the council,external.

When asked how he was being paid, one worker said: ""Food, whatever is left at the end of the night.""

Mr Ali said someone had turned up for an interview on the day that officers raided the restaurant.

Mr Ali, of Keighley, West Yorkshire, told the committee: ""He didn't tell me at the time that he didn't have his work permit. He wasn't an immigrant, he had the legality to stay in this country. He was just waiting for his work permit permission, which was granted just two months later.""

However, immigration officers told the committee the worker in question had been ""wearing a waiter's costume and attending a table when officers entered the premises"".

The committee's chairman, Councillor Brian Jones, said he hoped the case would be a ""warning shot"" to other restaurants.
