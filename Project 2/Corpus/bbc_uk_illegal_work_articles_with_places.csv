A takeaway and a shop said by the Home Office to be employing illegal workers have been fined a total of Â£85,000.

Papa Gino's on Grange Mount, Birkenhead, and the Day Choice Convenience Store on Pasture Road in Moreton, are now having their licences reviewed by Wirral Council.

Both reviews are ""in relation to the premises employing individuals who are not entitled to work in the UK"".

The takeaway was fined Â£45,000 and the convenience store was given a Â£40,000 penalty.

According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, immigration enforcement teams went to Papa Gino's in December 2024 after receiving intelligence about illegal workers.

They went to the shop in September 2024 and arrested a man for breach of bail because he had no permission to work in the UK.

The convenience store in Pasture Road, Moreton, was fined Â£40,000

A Home Office spokesperson said: ""Illegal working undermines honest employers, undercuts local wages, and fuels the criminal industry of immigration crime. This government is determined to clamp down on that illegal activity in every sector where it occurs, including retailers.

""Under this government, enforcement action nationwide has increased, with visits and arrests up by around 50% on the previous twelve months, and we will be stepping up that action further in the year ahead.""

Six businesses in Wirral were fined by the UK Government between January and March 2025.

A chicken bar where two illegal workers were found after a raid by immigration officials should be stripped of its licence to sell alcohol, police said.

The man and woman ran out of the back of Chicken N Beer in Stanfield Road, Bournemouth, when they were spotted by the officials in February.

HM Immigration Enforcement said the man entered the UK illegally on a small boat in 2022 and that neither of them had ever been allowed to work in the country.

The bar's premises licence holder, Roy Francis, said he had stepped down from being a director of the company that runs it before the man and woman were found working there.

BCP Council's licensing sub-committee was told the man's claim for protection was withdrawn in February 2024 after he absconded.

He told immigrations officials he had worked as a cleaner at Chicken N Beer for ""nearly a month"" and said he provided no official documentation to prove his right to work.

The woman entered the UK on a student visa in 2023 but her student leave expired in May 2024.

She claimed protection, which is still under consideration, last November.

The pair said they werepaid below the minimum wage and in cash,external, with the man telling officials he received Â£6 an hour for working three hours a day.

Mr Francis said the management of the venue's licence is set to be transferred to another company.

But BCP Council said that while it has received an application for the transfer, it has not received any payment for it.

The licensing sub-committee will make a decision on the licence, which could result in it being revoked, changed or left as it is, within the next five working days.

More than 100 migrants were arrested in a month in the Midlands as part ofa UK-wide crackdown on illegal working, the government said.

In January, 131 sites were raided in the region with 106 arrests, a 34% rise on the same month in 2024.

Across the UK, arrests in the month rose to 609, a 73% increase and a Home Office spokesperson said staff searched 828 premises including nail bars and car washes.

Home Office Minister Dame Angela Eagle said the government had put out footage of some raids in an effort to send a message with ""imagery as well as words"".

The Home Office spokesperson said a significant proportion of January's raids were at restaurants, takeaways and cafes.

Employers could face a fine of up to Â£60,000 per worker if found liable.

Later, the government's Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill will be debated in the House of Commons in its second reading.

The bill aims to introduce a raft of new offencesand counter terrorism-style powers to clamp down on people smugglers bringing migrants across the Channel.

The owner of a Lincolnshire car wash has been banned from running a company for five years after employing illegal workers.

Mohamed Hamza, 34, of Granville Road, Peterborough, hired the workers from Syria and Egypt to work at M&H Car Wash on Enterprise Way in Pinchbeck, near Spalding.

The business was fined Â£20,000 after the two workers, a man in his 20s and a man in his 30s, were discovered during an immigration enforcement visit in 2022.

Dame Angela Eagle, the minister for border security and asylum, said: ""Anyone who thinks they can profit from illegal working in the UK can think again. I am pleased to see justice has been served.""

The disqualification means Hamza cannot be involved in the promotion, formation or management of a company in the UK without permission from a court.

The fine was unpaid when the business went into liquidation in August 2022 with liabilities of more than Â£44,000, the Insolvency Service said.

Kevin Read, chief investigator at the Insolvency Service, described Hamza's actions as ""a serious breach of legislation and of the standards expected of company directors"".

Dame Angela added: ""We know that many people who come to the UK and end up working illegally often do so under extremely poor conditions and are frequently sold a false narrative about their ability to live and work here.

""That's why we're ramping up our enforcement work to tackle smuggling gangs and make sure those who abuse our immigration system face the full consequences.""

Ten people have been arrested during raids on suspected illegal workers at shopping centres in Northern Ireland.

The operation targeted mobile phone accessory stalls in 19 locations.

They included shopping malls in Belfast, Bangor, Londonderry, Lisburn, Newtownards, Armagh, Portadown, Dungannon and Enniskillen.

The raids were carried out by Home Office criminal investigation and immigration enforcement teams, assisted by PSNI and Police Scotland officers.

A firm that supplied illegal workers to pick crops has had its licence revoked following an appeal.

Derby-based United Recruitment Services supplied labour to farms in Lincolnshire.

An inspection by the Gangmasters Licensing Authority (GLA) uncovered 11 breaches of licensing standards.

They included using workers with fake passports and providing no proof of paying the National Minimum Wage, or holiday pay.

A breach of one critical licensing standard is sufficient for the GLA to revoke a licence. United Recruitment Services failed seven critical and four non-critical standards.

The firm's licence was first revoked in February but an appeal by managing director Chander Shekhar Guru allowed the business to continue trading until the case was heard.

Employment judge Peter Britton has now upheld the GLA's findings.

The licensing authority first visited the business at the end of October 2011 and found serious irregularities.

Judge Britton said: ""Of the 79 workers on the books at the time, only 15 were legally allowed to be working. A great many of them were illegal immigrants.""

He added that there were numerous entries in the files of employees, all from the Punjab region of India, who had been found to be working on ""forged passports"".

""To quote Oscar Wilde - one might be unfortunate, two might be very unfortunate but the sheer number in this case cannot be coincidental,"" he said.

""What it shows is that United Recruitment Services was in the business of employing illegal immigrants wholesale.""

The hearing, which concluded in Nottingham on Friday, was told GLA inspectors had discovered numerous serious failings in the operation of the business that Mr Guru ran from his home address, in Glencroft Drive, Stenson Fields.

As well as employing illegal workers, the company was found to be using two sets of timesheets and payslips, casting doubt on what tax payments were being made.

Mr Guru was unable to provide any satisfactory explanation to clarify issues identified by the GLA.

The judge dismissed his evidence as ""evasive"".

The ban will begin on 13 December, from which time Mr Guru will not be allowed to provide workers for agriculture, horticulture, food processing, packaging or shellfish gathering.",England,Derbyshire

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-65636770,"MGN journalists knew work was illegal, investigator tells court",2023,"Prince Harry is one of four people taking action against the newspaper publisher

A private investigator who worked for the Daily Mirror's publisher says journalists he dealt with knew ""full well"" he was a practitioner of ""the dark arts"" of unlawful gathering of information.

Steve Whittamore dismissed the newspapers' claims that only a small amount of what he did was illegal.

The Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) denies senior executives knew about the practices and failed to stop them.

Another key witness also described the MGN as an ""organised crime group"".

Mr Whittamore was giving evidence to the civil trial into breaches of privacy of the Duke of Sussex and other figures.

It is alleged journalists from the newspapers obtained private and confidential information about people's lives through a variety of unlawful means between 1991 and 2011 - including accessing voicemail messages on their phones.

Privacy breaches covered up, Prince Harry case told

Morgan told story was from voicemails, court hears

Prince Harry phone hacking trial explained

Mr Whittamore said he was in no doubt his newspaper customers were aware the information was obtained through 'blagging'.

If the information had been available legitimately, he said, the newspapers would not have needed his help.

At one point, he claimed he used an email address blag2049@hotmail.com to send invoices to his journalist customers, according to his witness statement.

MGN told the court this address had only been used once.

The company has admitted unlawful methods were used to gather stories, but denies that executives and editors knew.

Mr Whittamore was convicted of breaching information laws in 2005 after an investigation during which all his records and payment invoices were seized.

Cross-examining him, Andrew Green KC, for the publisher, suggested that some of these records suggested he had also provided legitimate research for journalists.

""Would you accept the majority of the work you did for MGN was lawful?""

""Perhaps you weren't quite as bad as you now wish the court to believe,"" Mr Green said, referring to Mr Whittamore's invoices.

""Well it wasn't me doing the checks,"" Mr Whittamore responded. His business involved dealing with a network of 'subcontractors' who were experts in blagging confidential information.

He was asked about one invoice for a ""mobile TP conversion"" under the name of Tom Newton-Dunn, then a young journalist for the Daily Mirror, but later political editor of the Sun, and now a presenter on Times Radio.

He told the court this meant getting a name and address for a mobile number, information which usually can't be obtained legitimately by journalists.

Steve Whittamore's statement claims he offered to obtain criminal records, benefits records, or bank details.

His services included providing telephone bills, ex-directory numbers and vehicle registration details.

A key witness in the civil trial also described the publisher of the Daily Mirror as an ""organised crime group"" similar to ""drug gangs and fraud factories"".

Graham Johnson, a journalist convicted of phone hacking, is now helping the claimants bring their case against MGN.

He said the company had been involved in ""systematic crime"" and a ""cover-up which has gone on for over a decade"".

MGN has admitted unlawful methods were used to gather stories, but denies that executives and editors knew.

Mr Johnson said as a journalist for tabloid newspapers he had investigated ""drug gangs in Liverpool, fraud factories in south-east London, street gangs in Birmingham.""

He said MGN was ""no different from an organised crime group. This is a true crime story which is constantly evolving.""

He was being questioned by Mr Green about his role in obtaining evidence of unlawful information gathering and passing it to the claimants.

Mr Johnson said at first he tried to get media organisations including the BBC, ITV and newspapers to report on the methods used by tabloid journalists but they ""didn't want to write the story.""

So, he said ""if the claimants asked me for information I also started giving them information. I had no other way of getting that information out there, because no-one would take the story.""

He said in effect he was ""letting the court be my newspaper.""

An American private investigator Daniel 'Danno' Hanks also gave a statement that he was ""sure that the UK newspapers and their journalists knew what I was doing, not least because they could see the product of what they commissioned"".

Mr Hanks told the court he had been convicted of at least 20 criminal offences but had decided to provide evidence of how newspapers used his services to ""right the wrongs before I pass.""

He specialised in using US databases to get celebrity information including social security information, voting registration records, phone records and details about vehicles.

Giving an example, he said in his witness statement that he had obtained phone records for a boyfriend of the singer Kylie Minogue.

He told the High Court he had a higher level of access to databases as a private investigator, but used this to provide information for journalists, which was illegal.

""I am able to get round the restrictions by simply accessing the database under the false pretence of legitimate PI work,"" he said in his witness statement.

After the phone hacking scandal broke in the UK, he said in his statement: ""Many of the tabloid newspapers appeared to be panicking about using anyone who was a private investigator.""

But, he said: ""They only wanted to distance themselves on paper.""

He was ""encouraged"" to send invoices using the company name ""British American News Service"", rather than his actual names ""Detective Danno"" and ""Backstreet Investigations"".

""I was never asked to change my product or methods which they knew to be illegal,"" he said.

Prince Harry is expected to give evidence at the trial in June. He is among four people whose claims are being heard in the trial as ""representative"" cases of the types of allegations facing the publisher. They will also help the court set the level of damages MGN should pay if the claimants win.

Others involved are Coronation Street actors Nikki Sanderson and Michael Turner, known by his stage name Michael Le Vell, and comedian Paul Whitehouse's ex-wife Fiona Wightman.",England,Scotland

A Surrey chip shop owner has warned other small businesses to check workers' legal documentation to work in the UK after he was fined Â£40,000.

Mark Sullivan, who runs Big Fry Fish & Chips in Egham, said immigration officers took away one of his managers in March, after the Home Office alleged they were using a false identity.

The Home Office told the BBC it was employers' responsibility to conduct right to work checks and that they were ""clamping down"" on those who failed to do them.

Mr Sullivan said the worker had supplied him all the paperwork, which included a copy of his UK passport, addresses, bank account and national insurance, which Mr Sullivan thought was legitimate.

Mr Sullivan toldRadio Surrey: ""We later found out he had a totally different name, which was different from all the paperwork he had given us.

""There were no red flags to suggest he was anything but the person who we were led to believe. He was also employed in the UK before he worked for us.""

He added the worker was employed at his shop on February 2023 and at the time he was paying back the worker's student loan and an attachment of earnings order from a borough council for his rent arrears.

Mr Sullivan said he submitted the documents, supplied to him from the concerned worker, to the Home Office.

He added he was not worried at the time because the documents were supported.

""I then received a letter from Home Office saying we were fined Â£40,000 for employing an illegal person. We were in total shock,"" Mr Sullivan said.

Mr Sullivan said the original fine was Â£45,000 but he was given a discount as he assisted Home Office with their enquiries straight away.

He said he was advised by an immigration lawyer to pay the fine rather than challenge it, otherwise the cost could reach up to Â£80,000 if he lost the appeal.

He added he was given an option to reduce the fine to Â£28,000 if it was paid within a time frame, which he paid.

""It's had a big impact on the business. There's a massive cash flow hole,"" he added.

""Obviously, retail trade is struggling and this is the last thing we needed.""

Mr Sullivan said there was ""nothing he could have done more"" to detect red flags and it was a ""genuine mistake"".

""When we employed him, we went online to confirm his right to work. One of the first questions asked was does the person have a UK passport,"" he added.

""As soon as we clicked 'yes', because as far as we were concerned he did, the website said no further checks were needed.

""We can't check people's passports whether they're true or not. We also paid him through the pay as you go system (PAYE).""

Craig Beaumont, executive director at the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), said a penalty of this amount could be ""fatal"" to small businesses.

""Small employers take their responsibilities seriously in necessary documentation checks, but ultimately they are not immigration officers,"" they added.

""They need a system which treats genuine mistakes proportionately rather than punishing them with crushing fines large enough potentially to threaten the existence of their business.""

A government spokesperson said: ""Illegal working undermines honest employers and undercuts local wages â it is against the law to work in the UK when you have no right to be here.

""Employers are responsible for carrying out right to work checks, there is comprehensive guidance on how to do this and we are clamping down on those who do not.

They added that right to work checks can be completed by either a manual check, checking using a digital verification service, or a Home Office online check.

Bosses at a scandal-hit care home used a self-employment sham to bring in illegal workers, it has been claimed.

The Morleigh Group ran six homes in Cornwall whichwere exposed last year for ""horrifying"" levels of care.

A BBC investigation has revealed the group used recruitment agency Ucruitment to get workers from Croatia, who have restricted rights to work in the UK.

The agency and the care home owners have denied any wrongdoing.

The Morleigh Group closed one of its care homes following a series of damning inspections. The company's owner, Patricia Juleff has sold the other five.

Former resident Beryl Charlesworth told the BBC some of the workers were poorly trained and spoke little English.

She said carers were inadequately trained with some not sure how to empty her stoma bag.

Beryl Charlesworth said she struggled to understand what the migrant care workers were saying

""They wouldn't clean it, and they'd get it all over my pouch so I couldn't touch it and I'd be in tears and I'd say I haven't had a proper wash this morning.

""Lots of times it made me feel very sad. At the time I thought I'm never going to get out of this place.""

Ana Maros was one of at least six Croations who worked for the Morleigh Group and were advised to set up as self-employed.

Croatia is a new member of the EU and self-employment is one of the only ways Croatians can legally work in the UK.

Ana Maros, from Croatia, set herself up as self- employed before starting work for the Morleigh Group

The BBC filmed Ucruitment at a job fair in Athens where they advised workers they could declare as self-employed to work legally.

But Ana failed to pay any tax when she was working in England and said her work was controlled by Mrs Juleff.

""You couldn't choose when you will work or not. They expect me to be always with my phone.

""And anytime they need me to answer on phone, which was - it wasn't nice it was really stressful.""

Employment lawyer Jacqueline McGuigan said there was clear evidence of a self-employment sham.

""If they were genuinely self-employed they would not be working for one care home.

""They (the care home owners) would be saving tens of thousands in tax and national insurance, holiday and sick pay, training.

""They would simply be running their own business and perhaps having two or three care homes and deciding what they would do day-in and day-out.

""They're providing a personal service to one care home every day at the control of the care home owner so to me that is almost a no brainer - it's open and shut.""

Ucruitment is run by Cyrus Ali who is also known as Ali Cyrus Zidane Mohammed and Salim Habib Mohammed Ali Shivji.

He and his wife were banned from being company directors after the Insolvency Service found they had cheated migrant care workers out of hundreds of thousands of pounds, for training they had promised but never delivered.

Ucruitment said all self-employed contractors, including workers from Croatia were legitimately self-employed and were fully compliant with all UK employment and immigration laws.

Owner Cyrus Ali said the agency facilitated introductions between clients and care staff.

Patricia Juleff ,who owned the Morliegh Group, has sold five of her care homes and closed another

She said: ""Ucruitment were engaged to ensure that the said workers had the right to live and work in the UK"".

The Morleigh Group homes' new owners, Cornwallis Care Services, believes the Croatian staff had no rights to work in the UK and have now ""halted"" their services.

A hunt master and assistant have been found guilty of illegally hunting a fox with dogs.

Tom Lyle, 34, and whipper-in Marcus Boundy, 23, were riding with the Portman Hunt near Stourpaine, Dorset, on 15 September 2022, when their hounds picked up a scent, Weymouth magistrates heard.

A drone operated by hunt saboteurs filmed the fox running out of a maize field with the pack of foxhounds in close pursuit, the court heard.

Lyle, of Bryanston, was ordered to pay Â£1,660 in a fine and court costs, while Boundy, of Exford, Somerset, will pay Â£810.

Warning: The video below contains scenes that some viewers may find upsetting

Three members of the Portman Hunt were originally charged by Dorset Police

In the drone images played in court, the fox ran into a wood closely pursued by dogs, who clambered over each other to cross a barbed wire fence.

Giving evidence, Lyle said the Portman had been on a legal trail hunt, following a fox scent laid by a hunt member.

He said it was normal for a trail to be laid through barbed wire.

Boundy, who was assisting those responsible for controlling the dogs, said he was happy to see them massing at the fence and thought they were following a trail.

Drone footage of the hunt was played during the trial

However, magistrates said it was ""inconceivable that Mr Boundy did not see or hear the hounds in pursuit"".

They said Lyle, as master of the Portman and the huntsman in charge of the hounds, would have been told of the fox's presence.

They said no effort was made to call off the hounds.

Magistrates fined Lyle Â£900 and imposed a Â£400 fine on Boundy.

On the first day of the trial on Monday, the owner of the land, Mark Pearson, 64, of Little Hanford near Child Okeford, Dorset, was told no evidence would be offered against him.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25127368,Saudi crackdown on illegal workers sparks heated debate,2013,"For Abu Osama al-Qeithy, starting up a small business in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, has been difficult.

He has paid for his operators' licence and insurance, and met all the conditions set by the ministry of labour, but his fast-food outlet is still standing idle as workers have become something of a rarity.

""I applied three months ago to get visas for foreign workers and am still waiting,"" Mr Qeithy says.

""The usual government reply has been: 'Your application is still being considered.' Every single day counts, especially because I have to pay the monthly rental to keep the shop.""

On 4 November, the Saudi authorities started rounding up and deporting foreigners who were working illegally in the Gulf kingdom, as part of a campaign to enforce new labour laws.

The clampdown has made it harder for some businesses to operate.

Thousands turned themselves in voluntarily, some with luggage in hand

Dozens of shops and restaurants across the country were forced to close as illegal migrants went into hiding or returned to their home countries to avoid being arrested or prosecuted.

Labour ministry officials say as many as 60,000 foreigners who had been violating the residence and employment regulations have so far been deported.

The start of the campaign triggered riots in some of deprived areas of Riyadh, with several Africans reportedly killed in clashes with police.

In the holy city of Mecca - some 875km (545 miles) west of the capital - 6,000 street cleaners went on strike for five days to protest against harassment by the immigration authorities as well as non-payment of wages and poor working conditions.

The cleaners, most of whom are from Bangladesh, only ended their strike after their Saudi employer agreed to renew their contracts and legalise their status.

Mr Qeithy's problems have been compounded by the corresponding sharp rise in wages sought by the foreigners working legally in the country. Demand is suddenly far outstripping supply.

Furthermore, it costs about four or five times more to employ fellow Saudis, many of whom are unwilling to do jobs seen by the majority as menial, such as cleaning and shop-keeping.

""They would not accept 2,000 riyals ($533; Â£327) a month,"" Mr Qeithy says. ""A friend told me he would not take the job even if he was offered 7,000 riyals.""

The crackdown is meant to lower the kingdom's unemployment rate

In recent years, laws have been toughened in an attempt to regulate Saudi Arabia's estimated nine million foreign workers, who make up about a third of its population.

""The overwhelming majority, which is about seven million, are working legally in the kingdom,"" Adnan Mandora, the secretary general of Jeddah's chamber of commerce, told the BBC.

""However, we have to admit that we were taken unawares by the massive figure of two million illegal migrant workers, who created a black market.""

Mr Mandora rejects accusations that the government is being impatient and reckless.

""The new measures actually came into force in December 2012, but we put them on hold after the turmoil created by deporting tens of thousands of such workers,"" he says.

""Then, King Abdullah issued a decree to grant all private companies and businesses operating in the kingdom up to seven months to put their illegal workforce in order. That ultimatum, which expired in July, was followed by a four-month notice to either leave the country or face arrest and deportation.""

The main aim of the crackdown has been to create new jobs for Saudi citizens.

The official unemployment rate hovers around 12%, perhaps surprisingly for an oil-rich country that is considered to have one of the strongest economies in the Arab world. Unemployment among the young is believed to be twice as high.

The government has also begun imposing penalties on companies whose workforces do not include a certain percentage of Saudi nationals. It has also imposed a ban on foreigners in some professions and restrictions on firms that supply imported labour.

Nearly half of those detained and then deported have been women

Other Gulf states have introduced similarly tough legislation in recent years in an attempt to reduce their reliance on foreign workers.

Some argue that the Saudi authorities are partly to blame for having helped create a parallel labour market that operates on the wrong side of the law.

""Red tape, the expensive process to get expatriates, and the limited quotas of visas for foreign workers that are largely secured by well-connected companies, have all contributed to creating this world of clandestine workers,"" says Hassan al-Sobhi, an economist and journalist at the al-Madina newspaper.

Mr Sobhi says the illegal migrants have also been victims of violations of the visa-sponsorship system used in several Gulf states, which requires immigrants to be employed by a kafil, or sponsor, which could be an individual or a company.

""Greedy and corrupt sponsors should be held accountable for selling visas to brokers, who in turn take charge of foreign workers and impose a monthly levy on their salaries. The illegal levy continues after their visas expire in return for not reporting them to the authorities,"" he adds.

The system gives the kafil the right to cancel the contract with a migrant worker at any time, and there is no way of challenging such a decision through official channels.

The crackdown on illegal workers has sparked a heated debate both on the streets of Saudi Arabia and on social media networks.

""It will have a positive effect on our country security-wise, socially and economically. It is also a historical opportunity for the sons of our country to replace the illegal workers,"" Khalid al-Ammar wrote on Twitter.

But his compatriot, Abu Azouz el-Shamail, argued that Saudis would not be able to fill the void created by the exodus of migrant workers, skilled or unskilled.

""The government will deport 100,000 workers and two million will come in to replace them. They leave via the immigration gate and re-enter via the new workers gate,"" he explained.",UK,

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwy8ee2w73jo,Illegal working and streams of taxis - BBC gains rare access inside asylum hotels,2025,"Migrants cooking meals in dangerous conditions in their rooms and evidence of black market work have been uncovered by the BBC, in rare access inside asylum hotels.

We went into four hotels, witnessing first-hand the lives of asylum seekers - some of whom have been living in cramped rooms for years and, in that time, have given birth to babies.

Migrants who had been moved from one part of the country to another told us they were sometimes forced to travel long distances back to attend NHS appointments  in taxis costing hundreds of pounds.

Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook said the BBC's findings confirmed the government must ""go faster"" in ending the use of asylum hotels, looking at ""all options including military sites"".

Smoke alarms covered with plastic bags as residents cooking meals used electric hobs in bathrooms

One asylum seeker who told us he had taken a 250-mile journey to visit a GP, with the driver telling him the cost to the Home Office was Â£600

Some asylum seekers saying they had no choice but to work illegally for as little as Â£20 a day to pay off debts to people smugglers

Our snapshot of conditions inside the four hotels raises wider questions for the government, with a large backlog of asylum claims having led to a reliance on this costly emergency accommodation for tens of thousands of people.

We asked the government how much it spends on taxi travel for asylum seekers through a Freedom of Information Act request, but the Home Office told us it does not keep these figures.

Mr Pennycook told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was ""questionable"" why asylum seekers needed to take such long taxi journeys and said the government would ""look into those cases"". But he said asylum seekers were not ""ordinary citizens just jumping on a bus"".

Asked why asylum seekers who had lost appeals still had access to the NHS, the minister said the government was tightening legislation ""so that our immigration rules are no longer abused"", because some people ""cycle regularly"" between multiple appeals.

All the names of the hotel residents and staff Sue Mitchell met have been changed to protect their identities

In one of the hotels, as I eat a meal cooked on the floor of a shower, I realise nothing has prepared me for what life is like for the residents of an asylum hotel.

I have been invited to join Kadir and his family for dinner - not in the hotel restaurant, but up in the rooms where he lives with his wife, Mira, and their three children.

An electric cable, covered in thick insulating tape, has been extended into the bathroom. Behind the door, Mira is crouching over a small cooker in the shower tray. Pans are precariously placed on a hob and she is stirring away.

As a pan full of oil starts to spit, I worry about the smoke alarm, but I needn't bother. The sensor in the room has been sealed tight with plastic bags.

To avoid the smoke alarm being triggered by cooking, a sensor is covered with plastic bags

This set-up is illegal and unsafe, but Kadir tells me his family would rather take the risk and make their own meals, than settle for the free hotel restaurant fare provided.

He dismisses that as ""chips and chicken nuggets"" and says hotel residents have complained it makes them feel ill.

The smell of herbs and spices wafting through the corridors seems to suggest they are not the only ones who feel this way.

""Everybody, they're cooking in their rooms like this,"" claims Kadir. ""We all do it, but we do it undercover.""

Some of the asylum seekers cook meals inside their hotel rooms

Of the four hotels I visited this summer for File on 4 Investigates, two sites accommodated families, while the others were for single people - most of them men.

But the stories in every hotel were similar.

To protect the safety of residents and staff, I am not saying where the hotels are.

I heard from families who have been waiting in the UK for nearly a decade for their cases to be decided - and from people who have had babies in the misguided belief that doing so will automatically guarantee mother and child being given British passports.

There were uplifting stories of human spirit - including an elderly couple, both with serious health problems, who still managed to help others in their hotel with food and emotional support.

But, at the same time, I have seen signs of hotel residents working illegally in the black economy and discovered that the asylum system appears to require an extraordinary number of taxi journeys.

August 2025: Protesters call for the closure of an asylum hotel in Epping, Essex

The government has pledged to end the use of asylum hotels by 2029. They currently houseabout 32,000 people across the UK,external, down from 51,000 in 2023.

Asylum hotels - including two of those I visited - have become a focus for vocal and sometimes violent protests this summer, after a resident of one hotel in Epping, Essex, sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl.

Journalists aren't normally allowed inside the hotels, but I gained access through migrant contacts who had made the journey across the English Channel from France.

The hotels were never intended to be used like this. The rooms look smart on review sites on the internet - with sofas, televisions, double beds, ensuite bathrooms. Everything is there, and you would be pleased if one was yours for a couple of nights.

What the pictures don't show is the wear-and-tear and the build-up of possessions that come from continuous occupancy over months and years.

Where reception once was, there are now security desks. Outside, there are bollards and warnings that the public aren't allowed in.

In recordings made as demonstrations unfold, Sue Mitchell takes listeners into the closed world of the migrant hotels.

Listen now BBC Sounds or on Tuesday 23 September at 20:00 on BBC Radio 4

At the hotels housing families, I am struck by the number of prams in the reception areas, and by how many babies and toddlers there are. With little or no communal space, younger children are left to play in empty corridors.

In one of the hotels, a friendly security guard, Curtis, shows me a makeshift running track he has set up for the children in an unused car park - and the bikes in the storeroom he has found and repaired.

When I ask the Home Office how many children have been born in asylum hotels, it tells me there are no figures available.

One of the first babies I meet is proudly held aloft by his father - they arrived from Somalia just weeks earlier and he tells me this is a ""British baby"", born on ""British soil"", who will, one day he believes, hold a British passport.

This is not, in fact, the case. The Home Office can still deport asylum seekers who have babies in the UK, although, according to Jon Featonby of the Refugee Council, there are extra safeguards which make it harder to forcibly remove them.

Kadir and Mira - the couple who cooked me a meal - have also had a baby since being in the UK. Kadir says he, his wife and their two older children were forced to flee Iraq. In his home country, Kadir says he had worked as a translator but was targeted by criminals.

The family has been moved between different hotels all over the UK since they arrived nine years ago. The Home Office initially rejected Kadir's case because of what it said was lack of proof. Two unsuccessful appeals followed. A third is currently under way.

The family occupies two adjoining hotel rooms - one for Kadir, Mira and their baby, and the other for their 12-year-old daughter, Shayan, and 14-year-old son, Roman.

Some children in the hotels have spent their whole lives there

Kadir says he wants to work, but won't do so illegally. However, he says he knows plenty of hotel residents who seek to supplement the Â£9.95 a week they receive from the government.

Kadir introduces me to Mohammed, who arrived from Afghanistan a few weeks ago.

Mohammed fixed up a job before he even hit UK soil, he says, as his cousin was already here and working illegally. He is now earning Â£20 a day for shifts that he says can last 10 hours, sometimes longer.

When I challenge Mohammed on why he is breaking the law, he says he has no choice because his family owes money to people-smugglers. It is a story I hear from other asylum seekers too.

Mohammed wants to send money back to his wife in the hope that one day - if he is allowed to remain in the UK - she will be able to join him.

In all four migrant hotels I visit, there are men and women coming and going at times that suggest they are working. Sometimes, delivery bikes are parked around the side of the buildings and occasionally vans pick people up.

In July, the Home Office conducted a UK-widecrackdown on illegal delivery drivers,external. It says 1,780 individuals were stopped and spoken to, leading to 280 arrests for illegal working activity. â¯A total of 53 people are now having their support reviewed as a result.

Staff in the hotel tell me it isn't their job to check these things, but security guard Curtis says he is not surprised. ""You've got nothing to occupy these guys. So of course, they're going to go out there and work.""

There seems to be a constant stream of cabs arriving and leaving the four sites I visit - although the Home Office says it doesn't have figures for the amount of money it spends on taxis at asylum hotels.

While residents are issued with a bus pass for one return journey per week, for any other necessary travel - for example, a visit to the doctor - taxis are called.

Proof of an upcoming appointment needs to be shown at the reception desk, where a taxi is booked on an automated system. Public transport or walking is not presented as an option.

This can result in some unusually long journeys and others that are unusually short.

For instance, when migrants move between hotels, they sometimes keep the same NHS doctors - especially for GP referrals. Kadir says a knee problem meant he was told to take a 250-mile taxi ride to see the consultant who had treated him at his old address. He says the taxi driver told him the return journey cost Â£600.

""Should the Home Office give me the ticket for the train? This is the easy way, and they know they spend too much money,"" Kadir says. ""We know as well, but we don't have any choice. It's crazy.""

I accompany Mira and Shayan as they go for a walk to a local chemist to pick up a prescription. It means braving a line of protesters shouting ""Go home!"" at them. They keep their heads down as police escort them through.

Later, I ask 12-year-old Shayan how she feels about the protests.

She says she wants to engage with the protesters and is frustrated the hotel staff won't allow her: ""Me and my friends have always wanted to go up to them and speak to them face-to-face. What is their problem with the kids as well?""

Shayan and her brother say they are often reluctant to take the school bus that comes to collect them each weekday. ""You never know what [the protesters] will do to the bus,"" she says, adding that she is afraid one of them might try to board it.

She wants to stay in the UK, she says, but her life so far has been spent in uncertain circumstances: ""Once we get settled in a place, then they move us, and then we've got to learn where we come from, like, learn that area, go to a new school, make new friends, and then once we've done that, they move us again.""

The Home Office says it is identifying more suitable relocation sites for asylum seekers, such as disused buildings and former military facilities.

In the meantime, ""we expect all providers to uphold the highest standards in preserving the safety, security, and wellbeing of those in their care"", said a spokesperson.

Since talking to me at the asylum hotel, Kadir and his family have been told they are to be moved on once more - to two hotels in different cities. Kadir and his baby daughter have been offered accommodation in one hotel, and Mira, Shayan and Roman in another, nearly 200 miles away.

But they are refusing to go. Kadir has already been told he has lost his weekly benefit and there is a chance the family will be deemed to have made themselves intentionally homeless.

The future for the family - like many other asylum seekers - remains anything but certain.

Fines for employing immigrants illegally have been issued in Cumbria and the north-east of England at a rate 25% higher than the UK average.

Some 150 firms - mainly takeaways, restaurants, car-washes and barber shops - have been told to pay more than Â£2m in the last five years, according toHome Office data,external.

The penalties ranged from Â£10,000 to Â£90,000, and 11 businesses have been fined more than once.

The Labour MP for Hartlepool, Jonathan Brash, said: ""British workers are being undercut by illegal immigrants.""

Using Office for National Statistics data for the number of local business units, the rate at which fines were issued from July 2019 to September 2024 can be calculated.

Across the UK, about 1 in 1,200 companies received a fine; in the North East and Cumbria that figure was 1 in 960. In Hartlepool, a town of 90,000 people, more than 1 in 250 firms were fined.

One - Marmaris Barber in Guisborough - is still trading despite having to pay out Â£80,000.

The shop confirmed it was still giving haircuts but did not respond to further requests for comment.

Marmaris Barber in Guisborough was fined Â£80,000 for employing illegal workers

Brash said a blind eye had been turned to the issue and that Hartlepool was a place already struggling when it came to employment and its local economy.

""We can't afford to be undercutting British workers,"" he said.

""It is something we've got to crack down on. It is in plain sight.

""I have no issue with people coming here to work but they have to do it legally.""

The government said, since it came into power in July last year,arrests and illegal working visitsby enforcement officers had gone up 38% compared with the same period 12 months previously.

The chairman of Reform UK's Sunderland Central branch, Chris Eynon, said the government needed to do ""way more"".

""We don't have a clue about how many illegal workers are actually in the North East and that's part of the problem,"" he said.

""We need to get British people who've lived here and paid in to the system for many years, they need to be going for these jobs not people who shouldn't be working illegally.""

Illegal working laws apply not only to those who are in the UK illegally, but also to those who are allowed to be in the country but cannot work, such as asylum seekers.

When someone claims asylum, they are provided with basic accommodation and usually just under Â£50 per week.

However, if their claim is refused, they may be permitted to stay but can no longer receive any public money, or money from any employment.

Pete Widlinski of the Mary Thompson Fund says he understands why people still work despite not being allowed to do so.

Pete Widlinski, who co-founded the Teesside-based Mary Thompson Fund whichsupports asylum seekers, said he understood why some people might take work despite not being allowed to do so.

In many cases, after having an asylum claim refused, ""you're still legally allowed to be in the UK"", he said.

""So they have every right to be here but they've got nothing.

""You can understand that the least worst thing they can do is working illegally, rather than go robbing, burglary, or mugging people in the street.""

The minister for border security and asylum, Dame Angela Eagle, said people coming to the UK have often been sold false promises.

""This ends up with unscrupulous employers undercutting law-abiding businesses and exploiting migrant workers, often treating them in inhumane ways,"" she said.

""That's why, as part of our plan for change, we are cracking down on illegal working at every level to end the abuse of vulnerable people, the immigration system and our economy.""

A doctor who illegally circumcised 41 boys in a ""non-sterile"" clinic has been told he can carry on working as an NHS psychiatrist.

Dr Hassan Abdulla carried out not-for-profit operations for Muslim and Jewish families at a clinic in Leicester.

He has been banned by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service from performing circumcisions for two years.

Suspending him would ""deprive the public of a competent psychiatrist"", a panel said.

Dr Abdulla, of Sudbrook, Lincolnshire, was not registered with the Care Quality Commission when he carried out the procedures between October 2011 and January 2012.

He was fined Â£2,700 and ordered to pay costs of more than Â£30,000 at Leicester Magistrates Court in July 2013.

An inspection found Dr Abdulla had failed to maintain a clean and sterile environment at the Al-Khalill Clinic in Evington, Leicester, and had failed to gain proper consent to undertake the procedure on a five-week-old baby.

The panel said his conviction meant he had ""been held accountable"" and his risk of repetition was low. Suspension would be ""disproportionate"", it said.

Dr John Brewin, medical director at the Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, told the panel there had been ""no concerns"" raised about his clinical practice there.

Passing a two-year ban on Dr Abdulla performing circumcision, it said his actions amounted to ""misconduct"".

Arrests for illegal work have surged this past year as police focus on ""unscrupulous"" employers who exploit undocumented migrants, the government says.

Immigration officers arrested more than 6,400 people in the past year in raids at businesses across the UK, data released by the Home Office shows. It said the figure is 51% higher than the previous year.

It did not provide numbers as to how many arrests led to charges, convictions or deportations.

It said immigration enforcement officials had ""intensified"" their work to ""tackle those abusing the UK immigration system and exploiting vulnerable people"".

Officers had visited more than 9,000 businesses - among them restaurants, nail bars and construction sites - to check paperwork and working conditions.

Such businesses had often subjected migrants to ""squalid conditions and illegal working hours"" as well as below-minimum wages.

The Home Office said there were a range of industries exploiting migrant workers.

In one case in Surrey, officers arrested nine people at a caravan park who had been working as delivery drivers.

At one one major operation in March, officers arrested 36 people at a building site in Belfast's Titanic Quarter. Some had breached visa conditions while others didn't have working rights.

Immigration Enforcement director Eddy Montgomery said there were many cases where people travelling to the UK were ""sold a lie by smuggling gangs that they will be able to live and work freely in the UK.

""In reality, they often end up facing squalid living conditions, minimal pay and inhumane working hours,"" he said.

Dame Angela Eagle, the minister for border security and asylum, said the government would ""continue to root out unscrupulous employers and disrupt illegal workers who undermine our border security"".

The government said it had also returned nearly 30,000 people over the past year who did not have the right to be in the UK.

It has said it is cracking down on illegal migration, setting out its plans in a White Paper to tighten work visas and those overstaying. It scrapped a special visa for care workers introduced during the pandemic, noting that this had been a pathway exploited by some.

There was mixed reaction to the plans, with some business sectors decrying the restrictions on work visas, while some Conservative opponents said the reforms didn't go far enough to stop illegal migration.

A west London councillor has been suspended by the Labour Party for employing an illegal worker as a nanny in her home.

The former deputy mayor of Hounslow, Hina Mir, tried to overturn a Â£40,000 county court fine issued in January but her appeal was rejected by the judge.

Mir, who is a qualified solicitor, reportedly paid a student cash to look after her children and perform household chores. She has now been ordered to pay the Â£40,000 fine along with Â£3,620 in court costs.

The Hounslow Labour Group said ""Hina Mir has been suspended by the Labour Party. We do not comment on any internal investigations"".

Conservative councillor Jack Emlsey claimed this was evidence of double standards and ""it beggars belief"" she was re-selected to stand in the 2026 council elections.

""I think Hounslow Labour has a lot of questions to answer,"" he added.

Two weeks ago, Mir was found to have parked in a disabled bay at the council offices without a blue badge, which Hounslow Labour previously said it was investigating.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c740vjrp81po,Will digital ID cards stop illegal working?,2025,"ID cards have always been viewed with suspicion in the UK. For some people they can conjure up images of authoritarian states like Germany in the 1930s, and men in jackboots barking ""May we see your papers please?""

There were two periods when we had compulsory ID cards here in Britain. The first was during World War One. The second was from the beginning of World War Two until the early 1950s.

When the system was abandoned in 1952, an editorial in the Guardian said: ""In this country we do not like this sort of thing. Better a little evasion and inefficiency than too much petty bureaucratic interference with the individual.""

The last attempt to introduce an ID scheme, in 2006, was born through familiar concerns about immigration and illegal working, as well as worries about benefit fraud and terrorism. It was scrapped by the coalition government when they came to power in 2010.

Fifteen years on, Sir Keir Starmer is proposing something slightly different. Not an ID card, but a digital ID scheme. It is a way of proving your identity, and your right to work in the UK, using modern smartphone technology.

Though the government also says it ""will ensure that it works for those who aren't able to use a smartphone, with inclusion at the heart of its design"". How that would be achieved is not yet clear, though it might mean people without a smartphone have to use a physical ID card.

What is the plan for digital IDs and will they be mandatory?

Digital ID is being sold by Downing Street as a way of reducing illegal working by migrants who do not have the right to earn wages in Britain.

The rules are already - in theory - quite tough. Employers can be fined Â£60,000 per illegal employee if they have not done the correct checks.

The government says the proposed new digital ID - which will cost the user nothing - ""will be the authoritative proof of who someone is and their residency status in this country"".

It will include the holder's name, date of birth, photograph, and information on nationality or residency status.

Instead of involving a physical card linked to a National Identity Register, this new proposal is more a proof of identity scheme. As well as proving a person's right to work the government promise that it will in future ""make it simpler to apply for services like driving licences, childcare and welfare.""

Ministers say that ""by the end of the parliament"" digital ID will be compulsory when checking someone's right to work. They claim that this will in turn reduce on of the ""key pull factors"" for people arriving in the UK in small boats.

""You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID"", the prime minister said. ""It is as simple as that.""

A more secure way of people proving their identity might reduce illegal working, and avoid the proliferation of fake documents in circulation.

At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy - but the idea is a picture would make it - in theory - harder to abuse that system.

But former Home Office official David Rennie said he did not believe the plan would have ""any bearing on people coming to this country illegally"".

""It's the black economy - by its nature, they're not performing right to work checks,"" he told BBC Radio 4's the World at One.

Mr Rennie, who now works at Orchestrating Identity - a company that performs these checks - acknowledged the system had ""gaps"" and could be improved, with some people finding it difficult to prove they could work in the UK.

""But that doesn't mean that you have to implement, at great expense to the taxpayer, a digital identity system for the whole country. They should really focus on improving what they've already put in place.""

Jill Rutter, of the Institute for Government, has meanwhile emphasised the need for ""stronger Labour market enforcement"" alongside the scheme.

""People are paying cash, people are working in what the prime minister calls the 'shadow economy',"" she said.

""It means people won't have an excuse for not checking, saying 'I thought they were British', and people won't be able to use fake ID so easily.

""So it will help, but I don't think it's an absolute panacea.""

The scheme will also take time. The phrase ""by the end of the parliament"" is shorthand for 2028, when the next general election is most likely to take place. This is not something that can be done in a year.

Most EU countries have some sort of ID scheme. One of the most modern ones is in Estonia where the focus is less on preventing illegal working, and more on easy access to things like benefits and health records.

But in countries like France and Germany, which both have long-running ID schemes, illegal working is still a problem. Though the French have long-complained that one of the pull factors to the UK for people crossing the channel in small boats is that it is even easier to work illegally in Britain than it is in France.",UK,

Concerns were also raised about wages after one worker said he was paid Â£300 in cash a week, which would equate to Â£7.14 per hour based on the time he worked and fall well under the national minimum wage.

Darlington Borough Council will consider the restaurant's licence at a meeting on 11 September.

Ersim Aydin, who was in charge of employing staff, told police: ""I don't normally ask for ID, I do ask if they're okay to work and nine out of ten I go with what they say.""

The venue's owner, Punch Pubs, confirmed the pub has closed after Ms Aydin, who operated the venue under a tenancy agreement, left her role.

The organisation said: ""As a valued part of both our estate and the Darlington community, ensuring the pub's long-term future is our top priority.

""We are continuing to work with licensing authorities and hope to provide an update to the community soon.""

After the licensing review was announced, Ms Aydin said she was ""so sorry"" if she had caused distress, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service.

""I gave all of myself to the pub and the people in it,"" she said.

""I never treated anyone like an employee or a customer â I treated them like family. Like human beings.

During his hearing at South Norfolk Council, Mr UddinÂ said: ""I've been running this restaurant for many years and I haven't experienced anything like this in my life.

Immigration officers have joined police patrols after a number of takeaway delivery riders on e-bikes were found to be working illegally.

South Yorkshire Police targeted e-bikes in Sheffield city centre and discovered ""a significant number of asylum seekers with no right to work"" were delivering food and others were victims of modern day slavery.

Food delivery couriers are self-employed and log on to apps to be able to collect takeaway orders.

Just Eat, Uber Eats and Deliveroo said they had strict employment policies and worked closely with the Home Office and police. All three apps use daily facial recognition to verify couriers, among other checks including Right to Work documents.

Verification checks are intended to prevent registered couriers ""renting out"" their accounts to those who do not have the right to work in the UK.

In a report, South Yorkshire Police said: ""Since January 2024, the city centre neighbourhood team has seized over 200 e-bikes and e-scooters, with approximately 10% of those seizures leading to further arrests for more serious offences such as drug supply and possession of offensive weapons.

""This approach also uncovered that a significant number of asylum seekers with no right to work were being employed as delivery riders and also potential victims of modern slavery.

""The city centre policing team conducts weekly targeted operations to tackle anti-social behaviour, with e-bikes being a strand of this.

""This is subject to daily patrols and regularly has more concerted days of action with immigration officers and plain clothed officers. The modern slavery team have also been involved in the joint operations.""

The report, to the South Yorkshire Police and Crime Panel, said other police teams including Doncaster's were now looking at the same approach.

South Yorkshire Police have seized more than 200 e-bikes and e-scooters

Uber Eats said it had a ""zero tolerance"" to modern day slavery and was the first platform to launch an identification system which requires couriers to take a ""selfie"" before a shift, which is then compared in real time with a photo in its database.

A spokesperson said: ""We are deeply committed to tackling illegal work and the criminal networks who are often behind it.

""We are continually improving our processes, including introducing industry-leading facial verification technology.

""Our rules are clear that couriers must follow the law, including the Highway Code, and we have measures in place to help ensure couriers use appropriate vehicles.""

All riders with Deliveroo, including substitute ones, complete up to four facial recognition checks per day. A team is dedicated to stopping criminals from co-ordinating illegal work.

A spokesperson said: ""Deliveroo has taken action to target illicit account sharing on our platform and as a result, have off-boarded thousands of suspicious rider accounts in recent months.""

Just Eat said it was fully committed to tackling all attempts to provide delivery services illegally.

A spokesperson said: ""We have substantially strengthened our systems against abuse, with daily facial recognition checks, and checks that are triggered when a new device is used to log in.

""Safety is taken seriously. All couriers delivering on our behalf must agree to follow all laws and rules of the road and any breaches are met with swift action and zero tolerance for criminal behaviour.""

The Home Office said Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just Eat would now receive information concerning the locations of asylum hotels to help better target people working illegally.

In August, the Home Office said there were 280 arrests nationwide following a week-long crackdown on riders working illegally for delivery firms.

Immigration enforcement teams targeted illegal working hotspots, with a focus on migrants working as delivery riders.

As a result, 53 individuals were having their asylum support reviewed, which could result in it being suspended or withdrawn.

A takeaway has had its alcohol licence suspended after illegal workers were found there during several immigration raids.

New Red Lantern in Chester-le-Street, County Durham, was accused of assaulting and obstructing Home Office workers and not registering staff, despite repeated warnings.

A Durham County Council licensing hearing was told staff also refused to cooperate with officers' investigations and shouted warnings to workers to evade detection.

Chris Woodrow, representing licence holder Song Min He, said he had proposed making several improvements, including taking a licence qualification.

But the Home Office warned the alcohol licence, for between 23:00 and 02:00, should be revoked due to the repeated incidents.

Lee Harkus, from Immigration Enforcement, said: ""This premises has been repeatedly found using illegal workers.

""The first visit should have served as an opportunity to improve the business practices, however, this was not the case.""

Immigration officers raided the premises on Front Street three times between 2019 and 2025 and found 10 people working there illegally.

Licence holder Song Min He said he rented the ownership of the takeaway to another company in 2022 due to illness, and did not have oversight of the business.

Dhax Limited, the company previously listed as in control, had already been fined Â£28,000 for employing workers illegally, with another potential penalty under consideration, the hearing heard.

Mr Woodrow said the licensee accepted Dhax had not ""done it properly, but he has got somebody else in now"".

However, the council's licensing committee voted unanimously to revoke the venue's licence, theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicesaid.

Mr Harkus added: ""The repetitive proactive obstruction and more recent assault of a law enforcement officer is a clear demonstration that the responsible management of the premises is not a high priority to the licence holder.

""He was not only present during the visit conducted in 2019, but he was complicit in obstructing officers entering the kitchen area and was witnessed shouting instructions to others to block officers, which resulted in him being forcibly removed.""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-62826181,Holbeach: Restaurant owner admits employing illegal workers,2022,"An investigation in April found that of the eight workers present at the restaurant five were working without the correct permissions

An Indian restaurant owner in Lincolnshire has said he employed illegal workers to stay open after the Covid pandemic.

Siddique Faud Rahman, from the Chameli Indian Tandoori restaurant in Holbeach, faced a licensing committee on Tuesday.

Five of his workers were found without the correct permissions during an investigation in April.

The committee said it was not satisfied the premises would not employ illegal staff again and revoked his licence.

When he appeared before South Holland District Council's licensing committee on Tuesday Mr Rahman, denied being involved in ""modern slavery"" but told councillors: ""I'm going to put my hands up, yes, we employed illegal workers.""

He said because of the Covid lockdown his business had struggled to pay overheads and after the furlough scheme a number of his workers had not returned.

""I had to get some staff working, or I would have to close my business down,"" he said.

Mr Rahman added: ""The workers were paid above minimum wage, plus accommodation and food â¦ there was no modern day slavery. They were loved and cared for as my own family.""

South Holland District Council's licensing committee said it ""could not condone a deliberate decision to flout the law""

The Local Democracy Reporting Servicesaid Mr Rahman told councillors: ""If this license is revoked then we will probably have to close down the business because we cannot survive.""

Sgt Lee Cotton from Lincolnshire Police, told the committee: ""I appreciate the difficulties with the furlough scheme, but responsible businesses do not employ illegal workers.

""They take the necessary steps to employ legal workers.""

Revoking the licence, the committee said the ""calculated risk"" taken by the business meant they ""could not be satisfied the premises would never resort to employing illegal workers again if it faced difficult conditions.""

Councillor Paul Redgate said: ""You keep saying you had no choice, everyone has a choice, you made the decision not to employ legal workers.""

It's Friday night in central London, and immigration officers have intel that a man is working illegally in adark kitchen- a collection of faceless businesses in a warehouse which exclusively offer food delivery and takeaways without the dining area.

Officers enter a hot, cramped kitchen in force, where they find a chef cooking alone.

A camera perched on a shelf nearby is seemingly monitoring his every move as orders on a tiny electronic machine ping in thick and fast.

Officers arrest the man for overstaying his visa and working illegally. He is calm, compliant, but clearly stressed.

A camera seemingly monitors the chef in the dark kitchen

The raid, which I joined, is part ofa Home Office crackdown on illegal workingand focused on popular food spots in the capital.

Sean Whippy is the chief immigration officer at Immigration Compliance and Enforcement (ICE) in central London.

He says dark kitchens can be problematic as they're away from the public eye.

""If they're tucked away, who is monitoring that? There is nowhere for the public to report bad working conditions.

""Dark kitchens run 24/7 - that's what their licenses will allow them to do. So we have to find out what shifts he's working.""

A chef is arrested for overstaying his visa and working illegally

Since July 2024 Immigration Enforcement has carried out 6,784 illegal working visits to premises and made 4,779 arrests â an increase of 40% and 42% compared to the same period 12 months ago.

In that time, 1,508 civil penalty notices have been issued, with employers facing fines of up to Â£60,000 per illegal worker.

Arrests can also lead to director disqualifications, and in serious cases, a prison sentence of up to five years.

Illegal workers arrested are either placed on immigration bail, or if they have no right to be in the UK, may be deported through voluntary or enforced means.

The man arrested in the dark kitchen is taken home to collect his belongings and is found to be living in overcrowded, squalid conditions.

He is placed on strict immigration bail and is required to report regularly to the Home Office.

Officers find workers hiding in the kitchen of a busy London restaurant

Those who claim asylum in the UK are not normally allowed to work while their claim is considered.

The Home Office usually provides accommodation support and a weekly allowance to cover other essential living needs, which is Â£49.18 per person in self-catered accommodation and Â£8.86 per person in catered accommodation.

One 17-year-old asylum seeker has told the BBC he turned to illegal work as he was ""unable to survive on the allowance"".

Ali - not his real name - arrived in the UK from Turkey in 2023. He began working for less than Â£1 an hour in a north London barbers.

""My shifts were 12 hours. They were paying me Â£50 per week.

""Yes, it is illegal, but a 16,17,18 year old young woman or man has additional costs and they have to work because the family has no money. The people they know have no money. You start life a little younger here.""

Ali, who quit the job and is now in college, says he lived in fear of being found out.

""It's such a terrible feeling. You have to work because you need it.

""You ask yourself, if I'm caught, will they send me back? Or will they give me a prison sentence?

""Or what kind of punishment will they give me? There are even some times when I go to bed at night, I couldn't sleep. This is also a difficult situation.""

Later in the evening, officers attend a busy restaurant in central London where they have previously arrested individuals for illegal working. They have intel that there are more.

It's peak service, and diners stare perplexed as immigration officers walk through the narrow alleyway of the restaurant in force.

In the cramped basement kitchen everybody is questioned including one man found hiding in a back room.

Two students are arrested for potentially breached their working visa conditions.

In a busy stairwell downstairs, they are questioned for hours about work rotas and payslips as the officers try to find evidence of illegal working.

They are later de-arrested due to a lack of evidence.

The Refugee Workers Cultural Association has seen a rise in asylum seekers turning to illegal work.

Chairperson Ibrahim Avcil believes legislation reform is needed ""in favour of asylum seekers enabling them to work as they arrive in the UK"".

He added: ""Because rather than people working without paying taxes, it is always beneficial for people to work and pay their taxes here in the UK.""

Home Office statistics published on Thursday reveal 748 fines were issued to businesses for employing illegal workers in the last quarter (January to March) - marking the highest level since 2016 and a 29% increase compared to the same time last year.

Dame Angela Eagle, Minister for Border Security and Asylum, said: ""Enforcement teams across the UK are working tirelessly to stop illegal working and the exploitation of vulnerable people.

""Clamping down on illegal working in all its forms is a critical part of this government's plan to strengthen the entire immigration system and disable the people smuggling gangs who sell false promises to migrants about their ability to work in the UK.""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czj70ynpm8po,Businessman banned for employing illegal workers,2024,"Four men with no right to work in the UK were found employed at Bubbles Car Valeting

A businessman has been banned from running companies for 10 years for employing illegal workers.

Edris Ali hired two illegal workers at the Tasty pizza restaurant in Hartlepool and another four at Bubbles Car Valeting in Guisborough.

They were discovered during Immigration Enforcement visits in 2020 and 2022.

Dave Magrath, from the Insolvency Agency, said Ali ""failed in his statutory duties by employing these six people who did not have the right to work in the UK"".

""Employers hiring illegal workers defrauds the public purse and puts potentially vulnerable people at risk of exploitation,"" he added.

Immigration Enforcement visited the restaurant in January 2020 and found two Iranian men in their 30s working illegally.

In October 2022, a visit to the hand car wash found four men in their 20s from Iran, Sudan and Ivory Coast working at the site.

Ali, 39, of Lorne Street, Middlesbrough, had been working as a director at the two companies in 2019 but resigned in 2022.

After the discovery, Hama Tasty Ltd was fined Â£20,000, while Bubbles Car Valeting was handed a Â£60,000 fine for the immigration breaches.

Ali was given a disqualification order at the High Court in London last month, and  the 10-year ban came into force on Tuesday.

The ban prevents him from being involved in the promotion, formation or management of a company without the permission of the court.

He was also ordered to pay Â£9,884 in costs.

The Home Office's Theresa Gregory said: ""Employers have a responsibility to carry out thorough checks on individuals prior to employment to ensure they have the right to work in the UK.

""A failure to do so may lead to further action being taken by the regulator.""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly7y9ldr4zo,Shopkeeper loses licence over illegal workers,2025,"The hearing was held at West Lindsey District Council offices in Gainsborough

A shop owner who has 52 stores across the country has lost his licence after police repeatedly found illegal employees working on his premises.

Police visited a store in Caistor owned by Arumugam Kalamohan and spoke to an illegal worker who said he was being paid Â£6 an hour.

A licensing hearing at West Lindsey District Council on Friday decided the only option was to revoke Mr Kalamohan's licence.

Sgt Amy Adams, of Lincolnshire Police's licensing team, said Mr Kalamohan had a ""long history of non-compliance,"" with illegal workers found at his stores in Grantham in 2018 and Stamford in 2020.

Mr Kalamohan told the hearing through an interpreter that he only visited his Today's Extra shop in Caistor once a week and relied on staff to oversee it.

According to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service, his legal representatives claimed that the illegal worker was a customer in the shop and was not working.

Police told the hearing that he was found standing behind the counter, wearing the shop's uniform and operating the till.

Officers said the man told police he was paid Â£6 per hour in cash, which is less than half of minimum wage, but they said a letter was later sent retracting the statement.

Police said the shop also did not meet the licensing requirements for maintaining CCTV or training staff.

Sgt Adams said: ""The licence holder owns many shops. With his experience, he should know legislation inside and out.

""We feel there is a total disregard for the law, and he continues to employ illegal workers.""

A recent report commissioned by the applicant found that everyone at the Caistor shop now had the right to work in the UK legally.

Ben Williams, representing Mr Kalamohan, told the hearing: ""He's not some gangmaster shipping in illegal immigrants and misusing them in his shops.

""He is extremely experienced, and accepts he should have known better.""

He added: ""You can't get compliance perfect across 52 shops.""

The panel unanimously decided to revoke the licence. Mr Kalamohan has 21 days to appeal.

Home Office teams carrying out enforcement visits in the South East

Between July, when Labour came into power, and 31 January, 3,930 arrests were made during more than 5,424 visits around the UK by immigration enforcement officers, the Home Office said.

A total of 1,090 civil penalty notices were also issued, with employers facing potential fines of up toÂ£60,000,externalper worker if found liable.

The government says those arrested for illegal working made the journey to the UK through a mix of routes, including by crossing the Channel, and by overstaying legitimately-granted visas.

Home Office minister, Dame Angela Eagle, said: ""Under our Plan for Change, we're ramping up enforcement activity to record levels to send a clear message that there is no hiding place from the law.""

But Reform UK leader Nigel Farage recently described the figures released by the government as feeble, compared with the numbers that had entered the country.

Home Office enforcement teams say their visits to work places are intelligence led, following information from a number of sources, partners and the public.

During recent operations in the South East, three Romanians were arrested at a factory in east Kent on suspicion of working in breach of their entry conditions and overstaying.

In north Kent, five Indian nationals were arrested at a takeaway shop on suspicion of overstaying their visa.

Three men - two Indian and one Afghan national - were detained at a restaurant in West Sussex on suspicion of overstaying and working in breach of bail conditions.

Meanwhile, in East Sussex a man and a woman from India were arrested at a takeaway on suspicion of immigration offences.

Across the UK, enforcement teams raided 828 premises including nail bars, car washes, and restaurants and made 609 arrests in January 2024 - a 73% increase on January 2023.

Peter Walsh, head of theMigration Observatory,externalat the University of Oxford, said: ""Visits to businesses and arrests in January are up , but that's only one month, so we should be cautious about inferring too much from a single month.""

He said more than 1,000 civil penalty notices were issued to employers over the first seven months of the Labour government.

""That is more than in recent years, although they were already trending upwards from historic lows after the pandemic.

""They're still below levels seen a decade ago,"" Mr Walsh said.

""Raids can only ever target a small share of the total businesses employing unauthorised workers.""

Justine Carter is from Unseen which runs the national Modern Day Slavery Helpline

Justine Carter, the executive director of Unseen, the anti-slavery charity running Modern Slavery Helpline, said: ""I think it is about sending a tough message.

""But, when you think about the thousands of pounds that are used for these types of raids, the very few people who are identified as a result is a real concern.""

She says it is crucial that enforcement teams also identify potential slavery victims.

""For victims forced or coerced into either travelling or working against their will, or against their visa requirements, it's really important that we can recognise those people, and that they can come forward and seek the help and support they need and deserve.""

Ms Carter said: ""It's critical we send a tough message to employers.  It's about illegal practices within legitimate supply chains.""

The arrests were made by Immigration Enforcement between October 2024 and September 2025.

It marks a 54% increase on the year before.

The Home Office said it was part of the ""largest crackdown on illegal workers since records began"" after an uplift of immigration raids on businesses across the UK.

It confirmed that ""more than 8,000 illegal migrants"" were detained across the UK within the past 12 months.

The nationwide operation resulted in more than 1,050 foreign nationals being removed from the UK over the same period.

The government said it was ""expanding right-to-work checks"" into the so-calledgig economy""where there are higher levels of illegal migrants seeking work"".

Its Â£5m crackdown targeted businesses who often rely on casual or temporary workers, including fast food takeaways, beauty salons and car washes.

The Home Office said it aims to ""shrink the black economy and penalise rogue employers who ignore immigration rules"".

The Sun newspaper reported,externalthat Channel migrants were able to rent out other people's Deliveroo and Just Eat delivery accounts via social media groups.

Asylum seekersare not allowed to work,externalfor the first 12 months of being in the UK, or until their asylum application is approved.

A Downing Street spokesman said it was ""right that spotlight is being shone on this racket"" and the government will not stand for it.

Food delivery apps Deliveroo, Just Eat and Uber Eats said they have strict rules and checks to ensure they only use riders who have the right to work in the UK.

According to the Sun's investigation, migrants staying in government asylum hotels around the UK have been earning up to Â£1,000 a week on the apps.

The paper said it found dozens of online forums where legal riders were sub-letting their Deliveroo and Just Eat accounts for as little as Â£40 a week.

Following the Sun's story, Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said he had visited an asylum hotel in London and seen ""clear evidence of illegal working"" on the apps.

""Labour claim to be cracking down on illegal working, yet this is happening from the very hotels Yvette Cooper's Home Office is running, and which she is funding with our money,"" he wrote on X.

The government said Border Security Minister Dame Angela Eagle will meet the companies next week.

""It undermines honest businesses and undercuts local wages, and the British public rightly won't stand for it, and neither will this government,"" said the Downing Street statement.

In response to the reports about illegal working, Just Eat said they are ""continuously strengthening our approach to ensure anyone who delivers through Just Eat's platform has the right to work in the UK"".

""Last year, Just Eat introduced a new mechanism requiring couriers to inform us that they are using substitutes and for these substitutes to complete right-to-work checks.""

They said they have brought in enhanced verification with a facial recognition test.

A Deliveroo spokesman said it had ""zero tolerance for any misuse of our platform and we will offboard any accounts which fail to meet their legal obligations when working with us"".

""We have a dedicated team in place who ensure Deliveroo does not work with riders who don't have the right to work in the UK.

""We take our responsibility extremely seriously and are consistently strengthening our controls against misuse of our platform, with further measures in development.""

All riders, including substitutes, must complete right-to-work checks and there is daily identity verification and new checks on new devices, they said.

And Uber said all couriers who use the Uber Eats app ""must undergo checks to ensure they have a legal right to work in the UK"".

""Working with the Home Office and the rest of industry, Uber Eats has launched new detection tools to crack down on anyone attempting to work illegally on our platform. As a result, we are removing fraudulent accounts and we are constantly reviewing and improving our processes.""

Elsewhere, the UK's independent inspector of borders and immigration said he believed the government's target of ending the use of asylum hotels before the next election was unachievable.

David Bolt's comments followChancellor Rachel Reeves's announcement in the June spending reviewthat the Labour government was committed to ending the use of hotels to house asylum seekers by 2029.

Mr Bolt told a House of Lords committee: ""I don't think it will be achieved, frankly.""

He said that as the government seeks to cut the asylum backlog, a ""significant increase"" in refusals has resulted in more appeals being launched over the last year.

Coupled with the lack of available of housing stock, Mr Bolt said, hitting that target would be ""really, really challenging"".

Mr Bolt questioned the government's ability to fulfil their promise to ""smash the gangs""

In response, No 10 said the comments ""underlined why the government's mission to deliver 1.5 million new homes is so important"".

They said there are 210 asylum hotels in operation, compared to 400 under the last government, and that ministers are ""determined to make sure that we end the use of hotels by the end of the parliament"".

Mr Bolt also said he advised the government that tackling the illegal channel crossings by going after the people behind the smuggling trade was not the right approach to tackling problem.

The chance to act, he said, would have been in 2018, when numbers were lower and were ""obviously going to get significantly worse"".

He said more could be done to tackle illegal migration operations by focusing on what attracts migrants to come to the UK, including by cracking down on illegal working.",England,Scotland

Two restaurants have been banned from selling alcohol after illegal workers were found at the premises.

Immigration officers visited Bambudda and TAO Asian Street Food in Darlington in July and found six people working illegally at the sites.

Investigators said a mother and toddler were among those living in poor conditions above TAO in Blackwellgate.

Benjamin Wu and his business partner Bich Thuy Nguyen said they were not responsible for employing kitchen staff at Bambudda, did not know some of the staff and were in the process of selling the business.

In the licence review, the Home Office argued it seemed ""impossible for the licence holder not to know the workers, given they were working at his business and living in the flats above his other business"".

Following the raids, Durham Police said the owners created new companies to transfer ownership of the restaurants, theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicesaid.

Police described Mr Wu as being ""obstructive"" towards officers during the raids, but he insisted he fully co-operated and felt ""the situation was discriminatory"" towards him.

Ms Thuy Nguyen told the hearing that it was part of their culture to help provide food and shelter for people in need and they did not wilfully employ anyone without the correct paperwork.

The highest number of e-bikes and e-scooters have been seized this year across Dorset by police in an effort to curb anti-social behaviour.

Dorset Police said the 99 e-bikes - including scramblers and motorbikes - along with 128 illegal e-scooters had been taken under road safety laws in response to an increase in reported incidents over illegal e-vehicle misuse.

The force said the record number came alongside officers using a new forensic spray from March to tag anti-social cyclists and motorcyclists in Poole and North Bournemouth.

The haul of seized e-bikes and e-scooters were crushed and recycled.

The force said use of the spray, SmartTag, a traceable water-based marking solution, is now set to be extended further across Poole and Bournemouth and the wider Dorset area.

The spray allows officers to mark bikes and scootersand the clothing of the rider. It can be traced using a UV light.

Insp Nick Lee, of the Poole neighbourhood policing team, said: ""The impact of the anti-social use of these illegal electric vehicles in our communities is regularly raised as a concern and that is why we have taken robust and decisive action to combat the issue, yielding a record number of seizures.

""Their unlawful use in public areas puts pedestrians and other road users at risk.""

The force also urged people to make sure they check vehicles comply with the law before buying them.

Delivery drivers suspected of working illegally were targeted by officers in Birmingham, Coventry and Hereford, the Home Office said.

Images showed enforcement agents apprehending two men at New Street railway station on Wednesday, as people were stopped for allegedly using modified e-bikes.

It comes amid a crackdown on undocumented workers operating in the so-called gig economy, as well as places like car washes, construction sites and nail bars.

The two-day operation saw 21 foreign nationals taken into custody for a range of immigration offences, the government added.

They included people from Eritrea, Guinea, Italy, India, Pakistan, Vietnam and Bangladesh.

All of them now face being deported from the UK.

The government says tackling illegal immigration is a priority

Matthew Foster, who leads on immigration in the West Midlands, said illegal working was undercutting legitimate businesses and allowing vulnerable people to be exploited.

""Those who choose to break the law by working illegally or employing illegal workers should expect to be caught and face the consequences,"" he said.

The enforcement activity comes after ministers promised to get tough on illegal migration to ""protect UK borders"".

Plans have included a focus on food delivery companies such as Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just Eat to prevent illegal working.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10515357,The tax-paying illegal workers living in London,2010,"The UK Border Agency removed 20,000 illegal workers in 2009

In his small two-bedroom flat, Felipe looks through a carefully filed thick pile of payslips.

They show he has been making regular tax and national insurance contributions and have been issued by a large well-known company, where he has been working for six years. Yet Felipe is an illegal immigrant with no right to work in the United Kingdom.

Professor Ian Gordon, the co-author of a report on the issue of illegal working, says that he thinks Felipe's story is far from unusual.

Prof Gordon, of the London School of Economics, told File on 4 that ""probably two-thirds"" of illegal workers are paying ""some kind of taxes and national insurance"".

""I don't think that it's the case that the great majority of irregular migrants live in and work in some entirely cut-off economy,"" he adds.

""I think that most of them are on the margins to start with and then well inside the margins of the mainstream economy with some kind of paperwork to support them.""

Some estimate that Felipe is one of about 200,000 illegal workers in London, although there could be more than that.

The UK Border Agency,externalin the South East carries out regular raids on employers. In the last financial year in the region, there were 22,714 immigration removals.

Back in his flat, Felipe produces his P60 - his annual tax statement. It shows he paid about Â£750 in national insurance over the course of a year.

Felipe, who is from Colombia and has been living in the UK illegally for nine years, claims he bought his national insurance number from a fraudster.

""I just use it as anyone else as anyone else would use his national insurance. I just hand it to my boss and fill out the forms and that's it,"" he says.

He adds: ""I see it [paying tax and national insurance] as a kind of payback for me being here. And I don't mind - and I prefer that - as long as I can work I am happy.

""The reason for me being here is not just because I want to become rich or because I want to come and take your jobs.

""I'm doing the job that most English people wouldn't do. I think I have never seen an English person cleaning a toilet.""

With tears in his eyes, he says he is doing it for his two young children and regularly sends money back to them in Colombia.

""I don't want to harm anyoneâ¦. It's hard to be judged as a criminal when all you are doing is what you think is best for your family. What I'm doing cleaning toilets - is that a crime?""

For Andrew Large, chief executive of the Cleaning and Support Services Association which represents contract cleaning companies, this is a familiar story.

""This is a problem that my members have come across on a number of occasions. It seems quite clearly that people are able to use national insurance numbers to which they have no right,"" he says.

""They may be legitimate national insurance numbers that have been misappropriated or alternatively, they may be wholly fictitious.""

Mr Large says the government needs to take responsibility.

""From our perspective, it would seem that inside Her Majesty's Revenue and Customsâ¦ there doesn't seem to be an effective process for handling any anomalies with regard to the number and the name which might emerge as part of this process. They certainly do not appear to be communicating with the UK Border Agency.""

A government statement said it was committed to stopping illegal working but added: ""It is an employer's responsibility to ensure they check their employee's paperwork to ensure they have the right to work in the UK.

""If they can't provide this proof, they will be liable for a fine of up to Â£10,000 per illegal worker.

""All government departments are working together to clamp down on illegal workers and the companies that employ them.""

Australia's highest court has rejected a bid by Qantas to overturn a ruling that it illegally outsourced 1,700 jobs during the pandemic.

The court unanimously upheld that the carrier had unlawfully laid off staff at 10 airports in November 2020.

The ruling found that Qantas breached Australia's Fair Work Act, which protects employee rights.

Qantas apologised for the outsourcing, but maintained it was a necessary financial measure during Covid.

The airline fired baggage handlers and cleaners at airports across Australia at a time when the nation had closed its borders and business was plummeting.

""As we have said from the beginning, we deeply regret the personal impact the outsourcing decision had on all those affected and we sincerely apologise,"" it said in a statement on Wednesday.

The High Court of Australia upheld that while Qantas had ""sound commercial reasons"" for the move, it had deprived workers of their rights to ""engage in protected industrial action and... bargaining.""

Workers and unionists described the outcome as a ""huge win"" after a ""David and Goliath"" struggle.

The Transport Workers' Union said the finding was proof that ""the entire Qantas board must be replaced by new directors including a worker representative"".

Its national secretary Michael Kaine called the carrier's actions ""the largest sacking found to be illegal"" in Australian history and promised that workers would now seek compensation in court.

Qantas has faced public outrage in recent weeks, after reaping record profits amid a series of scandals related to its actions throughout Covid - including allegations it sold tickets on thousands of flights that it had already cancelled.

A Kurdish crime network is enabling migrants to work illegally in mini-marts on High Streets the length of Britain, a BBC investigation can reveal.

The fake company directors are paid to put their names to official paperwork, and have dozens of businesses listed on Companies House, but are not involved in running them.

Two undercover reporters, themselves Kurdish, posed as asylum seekers and were told how easy it would be for them to take over and run a shop and make big profits selling illegal vapes and cigarettes.

We have linked more than 100 mini-marts, barbershops and car washes, operating from Dundee to south Devon, to the crime network. But a financial crime investigator told the BBC he believes it goes much wider.

The Home Office said it will investigate the BBC's findings.

Reacting to our investigation, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, said: ""Illegal working and linked organised criminality creates an incentive for people to come here illegally. We will not stand for it.""

For the first time, we can reveal the inner workings of a criminal system that lets asylum seekers work in plain sight on UK High Streets, in mini-marts that mainly profit from illegal cigarettes and vapes.

One man told us weekly takings from illicit tobacco at his shop could be ""sometimes, up to Â£3,000"".

The men who facilitate it all - so-called ""ghost directors"" - each have dozens of businesses listed on Companies House but in many cases are not involved in running them.

""The shop doesn't belong to me, it's just under my name,"" one of them told our undercover reporters.

Many of the businesses are dissolved after about a year, and then re-opened with small changes to official paperwork.

These businesses have ""all the red flags"" associated with organised criminality, a financial crime investigator told the BBC.

Kurdish builders offering to build elaborate hiding spaces for illegal cigarettes and vapes that would fool sniffer dogs

Asylum seekers, who said the Home Office had left them in legal limbo, working 14-hour shifts in mini-marts for as little as Â£4 per hour

The two Kurdish journalists involved in our investigation know that tensions over immigration are high. They worry that such coverage of illegal activities within the Kurdish community could inflame hostilities.

One of them is a former asylum seeker himself, and says ""I wanted to play a role in uncovering these illegal activities [...] to say loudly that they don't represent us.""

We found dozens of posts advertising mini-marts for sale across the UK

Over four months, we monitored a Kurdish Facebook group where businesses across the UK were listed for sale.

The reporters got in touch with three people who listed mini-marts for sale in Crewe, Hull and Liverpool. They said they were interested in running a mini-mart and trading illegal cigarettes.

In Cheshire, the man running a Crewe mini-mart called Top Store said he would sell his shop to one reporter for Â£18,000 cash.

The shopkeeper, who went by the name Surchi, assured our journalist that ""you don't need anything"" to own and run a mini-mart as an asylum seeker.

Surchi told us he was himself a Kurdish asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK in 2022, but whose claim had been refused.

When the BBC later confronted him, he told us he had paperwork proving his right to work. We asked if he could show us these documents, but he hasn't provided them.

Asylum seekers generally do not have the right to work in the UK while their claim is being processed. Permission to work is only granted in limited circumstances and is subject to strict conditions.

If asylum seekers are granted permission to work, they can only apply for eligible jobs on the Immigration Salary List.

These do not include being a shop manager or shop assistant.

Like our undercover reporters, Surchi told us he was from the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq, an area that straddles the borders of Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria. The region is often referred to as Kurdistan, but it is not an independent country.

To avoid scrutiny by the authorities, Surchi said he paid someone called ""Hadi"" about Â£250 a month to be named on official papers.

""That's his job and he probably has 40 to 50 shops under his name. There's no problem, he doesn't mind what you sell,"" he explained.

This arrangement let Surchi go under the radar of immigration enforcement and sell whatever he liked. He said he had never paid any council tax and that our undercover reporter would not need to officially register the company.

Immigration enforcement officers had only come by once in the past five years, when he was out, Surchi said during his sales patter. They never returned, he said.

Shopkeeper Surchi, right, talked to one of our undercover journalists about buying his mini-mart for Â£18,000

Trading Standards had raided the shop once, Surchi said, and he had been given a Â£200 fine for selling illegal cigarettes and vapes.

Shop owners in the UK caught selling these items can be fined up to Â£10,000, but the profits that can be made from such products far outweigh the penalties.

During a tour of the premises, Surchi took us outside to a so-called ""stash car"" where he said he hid the bulk of his stock until 17:00 each night, when Trading Standards officers finished for the day.

He also told our reporter that ""you could make a hiding spot"" for the stock in the shop's basement - where he also showed how he tampered with the electricity meter to avoid paying utility bills.

Surchi sold vapes to a group of teenagers while we were at the shop. ""I have customers that are 12 years old, I don't have any problem with them,"" he said.

Customers paid via a card machine into a bank account, he explained. Both of these belonged to his cousin, he said, who owned a mini-mart 15 miles away in Stoke.

On Facebook, we discovered Kurdish builders willing to help us conceal illegal vapes and cigarettes.

One of our reporters posted that he had bought a mini-mart in Manchester and was looking for ""a specialist to build a space to hide cigarettes in the shop"".

Six builders got in touch. One sent us a video of what looked like a vending machine for illegal cigarettes hidden in a loft, which, at the press of a button, pinged packets down a chute to a concealed vent below.

It was ""fine craftsmanship"" and cost Â£6,000, the builder said, claiming it was guaranteed to fool Trading Standards' sniffer dogs.

Watch: Hidden cigarettes dispenser to avoid sniffer dog detection

As we delved deeper into who officially owned these mini-marts, a network of ghost directors began to emerge.

One name that kept coming up was Hadi Ahmad Ali - the Birmingham man to whom Surchi told us he was paying his monthly fee. We found Mr Ahmad Ali listed on Companies House as being from Iraq, in his 40s and a director of more than 50 other businesses - mini-marts, barbers and car washes.

One of our reporters phoned him pretending to be an asylum seeker looking to buy the Crewe business to sell illegal cigarettes. Mr Ahmad Ali said the shop didn't belong to him but the lease was under his name. He confirmed he could keep it in his name for our undercover reporter, for a fee of between Â£250 and Â£300 a month.

He also said he could try to provide a bank card for the shop.

""I will give you a 50% guarantee that I can get you a bank card. I have another six to seven shops under my name in Hull and other places.""

Mr Ahmad Ali is still listed as an active director on several businesses on Companies House. We later learned that in October 2024 he had been disqualified from being a company officer for five years.

We linked Hadi Ahmad Ali (L) and Ismaeel Farzanda (R) to more than 70 businesses - including mini-marts, carwashes and barbershops

The ban followed illegal cigarette sales at a shop in his name in Chorley, Lancashire - including to a 16-year-old.

Separately, he pleaded guilty to his involvement in the sale of illegal cigarettes in Lincolnshire and was sentenced to six months in prison, suspended for 18 months.

When later confronted by the BBC, Mr Ahmad Ali told us these mini-marts were nothing to do with him, and he had contacted Companies House to get his name removed from the businesses.

A spokesperson for Companies House said it ""now has greater powers to share information and support law enforcement investigations"".

""Where criminality is suspected, information and intelligence are shared with relevant partners.""

Our research linked Mr Ahmad Ali to another man, Ismael Ahmedi Farzanda, who we found was a ghost director and responsible for 25 mini-marts.

Mr Farzanda's name came up because Companies House filings showed he had taken over as company director from Mr Ahmad Ali at seven mini-mart businesses. The pair also shared a co-directorship on one shop in Blackpool.

One of our reporters managed to call Mr Farzanda, using the same cover story as he had told Mr Ahmad Ali.

""I just put the shops under my name for people,"" said Mr Farzanda who, like Mr Ahmad Ali, was based in the West Midlands. He told us an ""accountant"" would take care of the paperwork, bank accounts and payments to him, and that he would have no problem with us selling illegal cigarettes.

The only request he had was that if the undercover reporter was ever caught by the police, he should let him know immediately.

""If you know you're caught, tell us so that for the interviews we can change the name and not get in trouble,"" he told our reporter.

Mr Farzanda was fined Â£4,500 in August after one shop, registered in his name in Haslingden, Lancashire, was caught selling illegal vapes to a 14-year-old, according to local media reports.

Seventeen shops registered under the names of Mr Ahmad Ali and Mr Farzanda have been raided since 2021 with illegal tobacco and vapes seized, Trading Standards sources confirmed.

Confronting the ""ghost directors"" behind the network

Despite being registered on official documents as being from Iran, Mr Farzanda told our undercover reporter he was actually from the Sharazoor district in neighbouring Iraq.

Both our undercover reporters say they are aware of Kurdish people who have arrived in the UK on small boats and pretended to be Iranian, believing their asylum claims would have a better chance of success.

When later presented with our evidence, Mr Farzanda denied all the allegations put to him by the BBC.

When we looked into the official records attached to all the companies listed for Mr Ahmad Ali and Mr Farzanda, a suspicious pattern emerged.

We found companies would be set up for a year, dissolved, and then set up again - each time with a slightly different spelling of the businesses' names. The men's names and birthdays would also be changed slightly.

""Why are they doing that? It's most likely to evade tax and to dodge scrutiny by authorities,"" said financial crime investigator Graham Barrow, when we showed him our data.

We have also confirmed details of two further ghost directors - with 40 companies listed between them.

This UK-wide network of more than 100 company directorships in the names of just four individuals has ""all the red flags that I would associate with organised criminal networks"", said Mr Barrow.

The network of businesses identified by the BBC could stretch even wider across the country, said Mr Barrow: ""I certainly think it's hundreds. It could easily be bigger than that,"" he said.

We visited more than a dozen mini-marts linked to this network of ghost directors.

Everywhere we went, it was the same story - the shops were on rundown High Streets in some of the UK's most deprived areas, such as Blackpool, Bradford, Huddersfield and Hull.

All but one of the shops sold counterfeit or smuggled cigarettes for about Â£4 per pack, instead of the average UK price of Â£16 for a pack of 20.

The sale of illegal cigarettes and vapes costs the country at least Â£2.2bn in lost revenue, according to the HMRC

As well as Surchi's story in Crewe, our investigation revealed details of other Kurdish asylum seekers being employed illegally.

A mini-mart worker in a Blackpool shop linked to one of the ghost directors told us he had left an asylum-seeker hotel in Liverpool to work 14-hour days at the shop. ""In return I get Â£60 to Â£65 [per day],"" he told us. ""For three months, I worked for Â£50 [per day].""

He was interviewed by the Home Office four months ago, he said, but hasn't heard anything since. The shop had been raided by Trading Standards three times, he told us - but he described that as ""nothing"".

""Just give them any name and they will walk away,"" he explained, saying that whenever he was asked who he was, he would give the name of a famous Kurdish singer, Aziz Waisi.

He did say he was worried by immigration enforcement, however. ""They [Trading Standards] take the cigarettes and leave, but immigration makes you do fingerprints.""

We also found another Kurdish shopworker in a Salford shop registered under Ismaeel Farzanda's name, who said he was in limbo. ""I've been here for six months and I still haven't claimed asylum,"" he said.

The 42-year-old said he had first come to the UK as a teenager, before returning to Kurdistan.

He said he returned to the UK this year and ""they found my previous fingerprint records but nothing came of it"". He said he was staying with friends.

""Honestly, we're all struggling here and don't know what to do.""

The government says it has increased raids by 51% and this year raised the fines for businesses to Â£60,000 per person found working illegally.

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood added that the government has ""seized millions of pounds worth of unlicensed goods, banned dodgy directors and removed more than 35,000 people with no right to be in the UK.""

Acting Insp Jess Lawlor, from Suffolk Police, said: ""This operation demonstrates our commitment to protecting vulnerable individuals and ensuring businesses operate within the law.""

During the multi-agency operation welfare checks were conducted with all workers and, where concerns were identified, safeguarding measures were implemented.

The owners of the businesses found to be employing illegal workers, meanwhile, were handed fines.

""Exploitation and modern slavery have no place in our communities,"" added Acting Insp Lawlor.

""We will continue to work to identify those who may be vulnerable, offer them support, and take action against those who seek to exploit others.

Five of the men were detained pending removal from the UK and the remaining six were released on immigration bail, the Home Office said.

The investigation involved the Home Office's Immigration Enforcement team, Surrey Police and the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit.

Illegal workers arrested in Christmas market raid

Home Office immigration enforcement inspector Sam Malhotra said there was ""no hiding place"" from the immigration rules.

""We are working around the clock to identify this criminality wherever it is taking place and those found working illegally will be arrested, detained and removed wherever possible.

""This activity is ramping up right across the UK with enforcement levels at their highest rate in British history.""

Latest figures revealed that more than 8,000 illegal migrants have been arrested after 11,000 raids were carried out by Immigration Enforcement from October 2024 to September 2025.

It marks the largest enforcement crackdown on illegal working since records began and sits alongside action to remove nearly 50,000 people with no right to be in the UK since government came into power.

Spelthorne Borough Commander Insp Matt Walton said: ""We will always look to protect vulnerable people exploited by criminals, but where people are deliberately trying to work outside of the law, we will join with partners to take enforcement action.

""By working alongside partner agencies on specific operations, we can effectively tackle these types of offences, while also looking for wider criminality.""

Seven people working on the Queensferry Crossing have been arrested on suspicion of working illegally after an investigation by the Home Office.

The workers were not directly employed by the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, but had been hired via a sub-contractor.

The raid took place on Monday. The workers are due to appear before Dunfermline Sheriff Court.

Bridge officials said the project contractor had co-operated fully.

Scotland's Economy Secretary Keith Brown has written to the Home Office to seek reassurance over the measures used to address the issue of illegal foreign workers.

Mr Brown said: ""It's important that the construction industry can responsibly provide the correct resource to support the delivery of our pipeline of infrastructure projects.

""Across our projects contractors have assured us that they carry out all business and operations in such a manner as to fully comply with and meet all legislative requirements, including all relevant employment laws.

""As such, it is standard policy to carry out checks to ensure that all direct employees and staff have the necessary and valid credentials as is required for them to be legitimately employed prior to their appointment. We have also received assurance that it is also a requirement that second tier subcontractors also meet these obligations.""

More than 10,000 people have worked on the bridge construction site since work was started in 2011.

Responding to news of the arrests, the union UCATT said the incident was just one example of wider workplace abuses on the site.

Four illegal construction workers have been detained pending their removal from the UK.

Supported by Avon and Somerset Police, the Home Office's Immigration Enforcement team arrested 15 illegal workers at the Goldbeck Solar Farm in Bristol.

The remaining 11 people have been placed on immigration bail with strict reporting conditions, and their employer could face a fine of up to Â£45,000 per illegal worker. Goldbeck Solar Farm said it had launched an urgent investigation into the incident.

The operation forms part of the government's zero tolerance approach to illegal working under its Plan for Change and follows a 50% surge in visits and arrests since July 2024.

Those arrested were of Kazakhstani, Turkish, Georgian, Uzbekistani, Kyrgyz and Tajikistani nationalities, and 13 had entered the UK on temporary work visas.

All 13 submitted asylum claims prior to their visas expiring. Of these, 10 claims remain outstanding and three claims have been refused.

One individual had entered the UK on a standard visitor visa and claimed asylum - which is still outstanding.

Another individual entered the country on a Turkish ECAA business visa but was arrested for working in breach of his conditions.

The liable employer could face a substantial fine if found to have employed illegal workers and failed to conduct relevant pre-employment checks.

Penalties include a fine of up to Â£45,000 per illegal worker for a first breach, and up to a maximum of Â£60,000 for repeat offending.

Dame Angela Eagle, minister for border security, immigration and asylum, said illegal working ""will no longer be tolerated"" under the Plan for Change.

""We are taking a tough approach to tackling illegal working right across the UK and this operation is just another example of our relentless focus to disrupt immigration offenders.

""From our city centres to rural farmland, there should be no hiding place from the law.

""That's why we have increased arrests, sanctioned rogue employers, and continue to safeguard those exploited from this criminality.""

The government has returned more than 35,000 people with no right to be in the UK since July 2024, including failed asylum seekers, immigration and foreign national offenders.

A council is planning action over an illegal development near a nuclear weapons site.

Work has been carried out on land opposite the Atomic Weapons Establishment's Aldermaston campus despite a temporary stop notice, West Berkshire Council said.

It said the ""scale and intensity of the activity"" had distressed residents in the Aldermaston and Tadley areas.

An online petition said construction machinery was operating from 06:00 GMT until nearly midnight with a view to building static homes.

The petition, which has attracted more than 300 signatures, said the work had left people feeling ""unsafe, anxious, and unprotected"".

It added: ""We urgently need intervention to stop further environmental harm, prevent unregulated development, and ensure the well-being of residents.""

The landowner put in a planning application on 3 November for 13 plots, the council said.

The temporary stop notice was issued the following day.

However, unauthorised works continued over the weekend, the authority added.

It added: ""We fully understand how distressing this has been for nearby residents.

""[Those] who witness threatening behaviour or feel unsafe should contact the police.""

The authority said it was discussing safety issues with both Thames Valley Police and the Ministry of Defence Police.

The judge says the firm committed ""egregious and widespread"" violations of federal labour law at its stores in cities of Buffalo and Rochester.

The coffee chain has been ordered to rehire the ex-workers and compensate others who were affected.

In response, Starbucks said its actions were lawful and in line with policies.

""We believe the decision and the remedies ordered are inappropriate given the record in this matter and are considering all options to obtain further legal review,"" Starbucks told the BBC.

In a more than 200 page decision, Michael A Rosas, who is a federal administrative law judge, also ordered Starbucks to rehire another worker that he ruled had been illegally forced out of their job.

Mr Rosas said Starbucks had showed ""a general disregard for the employees' fundamental rights"" in response to union campaigns.

The judge added that the company interrogated and threatened workers and restricted discussion of pay.

It also repeatedly sent high-ranking staff to stores ""in order to more closely supervise, monitor, or create the impression that employees' union activities are under surveillance,"" he said.

The NLRB is an independent federal agency with the power to safeguard employees' rights to unionise at their workplaces.

Starbucks set for walkouts in US over unionisation

Michael Sanabria, a Starbucks barista in Buffalo, said the ruling was ""such a massive win for us, and for the labour movement as a whole.""

""The decision results from months of tireless organising by workers... demanding better working conditions in the face of historical, monumental, and now deemed illegal union-busting,"" said Michelle Eisen, a barista at another Starbucks location in Buffalo.

Last year, workers at around 270 of Starbucks stores across the US voted to join unions, despite opposition from the firm. Starbucks has around 9,000 company-owned stores in the US.

Union campaigners have accused the company of dragging its feet at the bargaining table and violating labour laws as it tries to shut down the movement.

Starbucks - which has long prided itself on its reputation as a progressive, worker-friendly employer - has said it respects workers' right to protest.

In recent months the company has raised pay and made other changes in response to the discontent.

A karaoke bar could lose its licence after illegal workers and ""suspicious"" massage rooms were found during police searches.

West Yorkshire Police officers, licencing officers from Kirklees Council and immigration officers from the Home Office carried out a joint operation in Huddersfield on 25 April.

The discovery of the illegal workers at Hao Lai Karaoke Bar, on Kirkgate, as well as three massage rooms in the basement, resulted in two women being detained and one man arrested.

The police have asked the council to review the bar's licence, despite its holder saying any illegal activity had been ""quickly stopped"".

The review hearing will take place on 7 July.

The Home Office and police have also asked the local authority to ""seriously consider"" revoking the bar's licence altogether.

A spokesperson for West Yorkshire Police said: ""The operators have no regard for UK laws, and revocation of this licence will send a strong message to other business operators within Kirklees considering employing illegal workers.

""The current fine for employing illegal workers can be up to Â£60,000.

""The use of illegal workers may also indicate that the workers could be victims of people smuggling or modern-day slavery.""

In the summer of 2024, the force also received intelligence about illicit sexual activities taking place in the rooms below the bar, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service.

Documents said that when visiting the premises, officers found a bed in one room, along with empty condom wrappers and baby wipes.

At the time, officers informed the premises licence holder, who was working behind the bar, that such activities must cease immediately.

Officers returned to the premises in September 2024, where they found the bed had been replaced with a massage table and ""no evidence"" of sexual activity was present.

Several other breaches of the licensing objectives were noted by Kirklees Council licensing officers in the latest investigation, including a lack of CCTV recordings, failure to maintain refusal logs, no incident log being available for inspection, and no evidence of training logs.

In submissions ahead of the hearing, the bar's licence holder denied employing any staff who did not have the right to work in the UK.

Hundreds of London minicab drivers may be working fraudulently after buying qualifications, the BBC has found.

Drivers must sit mandatory exams to get a licence. But a BBC undercover investigation has exposed colleges cheating the required tests.

Transport for London (TfL) said it would immediately investigate at least 1,667 applications in light of the evidence.

TfL, the licensing authority, said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the findings.

The growth in taxi booking firms such as Uber have seen the number of private hire vehicle licences in use that were issued in the capital surge by 86% between 2011 and 2018, from 61,200 to 113,645.

Under the cab application process, along with a criminal record check and medical test, drivers must sit a topographical exam and an English test at one of eight official TfL testing centres.

Evidence of these exams can also be accepted via other qualifications including BTecs, which are usually taken at private colleges and centres.

The qualification can be used to gain a minicab licence from many councils across the UK.

One of these colleges, Vista Training Solutions in Newham, east London, offered to take the tests for several BBC researchers for Â£500 per BTec.

Secret recordings show manager Gerti Qamili accepting money to cheat exams

At a mandatory English and maths assessment answers were read out to eight candidates taking the BTec fraudulently.

Registers were falsified before the online BTec exam was taken by the managers on the candidates' behalf.

The researcher, who had neither attended any classes nor completed an exam, received a BTec level two certificate in Introduction to the Role of the Professional Taxi and Private Hire Driver.

Another undercover BBC researcher, who had also done nothing other than pay, subsequently received a certificate stating he had passed his BTec level two.

Vista was one of the several centres the BBC heard was facilitating fraudulently obtained qualifications.

During undercover filming Gerti Qamili, a college manager, bragged he had helped ""over 300 students"" fraudulently achieve the qualification.

The scam had been successfully winning licences from TfL for more than two years, Mr Qamili said.

He warned the researchers ""not to tell anyone that someone does the test for you"".

Vista Training Solutions has received more than Â£1.5m since 2018 for apprenticeships.

Ofsted singled out the college for ""ensuring that the training meets the needs of the industry"" ina monitoring report,externalin December last year.

Abdalla Jamac was filmed handing out answers to a test during undercover filming at Vista Training Solutions

Caroline Pidgeon, deputy chair of London's Transport Committee, said: ""Passengers are getting into those vehicles, and they need to know they're safe.

""To hear parts of that (qualifications) are being forged around London, that's not right, that's really worrying and TfL need to get a grip on this.""

Helen Chapman, a director at TfL, said: ""It is deeply concerning to learn that some colleges or schools could be illegally providing certificates.

""We will support the relevant authorities with any wider investigations into these organisations. We will take immediate action against any driver identified as fraudulently obtaining a licence.""

Uber's London licence renewed for two months

TfL said all new applications in which the topographical test had been taken at a private college rather than at one of its eight official examination centres had now been put on hold.

The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan whose office oversees TfL said: ""This was a very serious breach.""

He added that TfL would be working with the police to investigate any rules that had been broken.

""The reason why it's so serious is because we know that in the past there have been examples of serious criminal offences committed,"" he added.

Vista Training Solutions said it was shocked by the allegations, which it said would be a violation of its policies, as well as a crime. It added it would be launching its own internal investigation.

Mr Qamili and Abdalla Jamac, who the company claimed were responsible for the BTec level two taxi course, are no longer working at Vista.

Both were contacted by the BBC but refused to comment.

Parts of a historic New York synagogue have been ordered to be vacated, after a secret tunnel constructed underneath it destabilised the sanctuary.

A fight erupted on Monday between police and community members who dug the tunnel, after a cement truck arrived to fill it. Nine were arrested.

Officials said the tunnel, which was 60ft (18m) long, was not properly reinforced.

The city issued an emergency order to stabilise the structure on Wednesday.

""We have been on site in Crown Heights since [Tuesday] morning to investigate the illegal excavation work found underneath the buildings, and its impacts on the neighbouring structures,"" New York's Department of Buildings said.

""We will continue to monitor the progress of this emergency stabilization work,"" officials added, warning that additional action may be required.

City inspectors were called to the Chabad-Lubavitch headquarters in Brooklyn on Monday to conduct an emergency structural inspection under concerns that the illegal tunnel could have caused damage to the famous property.

A brawl then ensued between police and some men inside the synagogue resisting the effort.

They were charged with criminal mischief, reckless endangerment and obstructing governmental administration.

The tunnels were built under a prominent street in Brooklyn, where the Chabad-Lubavitch headquarters are located. The building is one of the most significant Jewish sites in the city.

The building, which sees thousands of visitors each year, was formerly the home of the leader of the Orthodox Jewish movement - Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson.

The rabbi is credited with leading the Chabad-Lubavitch and revitalising the Hasidic religious community after it was devastated in the Holocaust. He died in 1994, but his headquarters remains a well-known centre for the Jewish religion.

It is unclear who built the tunnel, how they did it and what their motivations were. It appears the tunnel connects to at least one other building on the street in Brooklyn.

But a spokesperson for the Chabad blamed the incident on a ""group of extremist students"".

And Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky, the chairman of the Chabad, thanked police for their efforts and said the community was ""pained by the vandalism of a group of young agitators"".

""These odious actions will be investigated, and the sanctity of the synagogue will be restored,"" he said.

One local told the New York Times that the men sought to build the tunnel to hasten the expansion of the synagogue.

Some members who have attended services and functions at the Chabad have reportedly complained about overcrowding in the building in recent years.",UK,

Two Chinese men, aged 24 and 35, were placed on immigration bail.

Ms Farleigh, regional director for the UK Border Agency in Wales, said: ""Through successful operations like this we are sending a simple message to immigration offenders living and working across Wales - more raids are planned and you will be caught.

""Illegal working undercuts businesses that stay within the law and exploits foreign workers.

He is prevented from becoming involved in the promotion, formation or management of a company, without the permission of a court.

""Vittorio Dragoti's disqualification as a company director is a result of ongoing close collaboration between the Insolvency Service and our partners at the Home Office to clamp down on rogue directors,"" Mr Magrath added.

Sixteen suspected illegal workers have been arrested in an operation by Home Office enforcement officers.

Six restaurants and takeaways in Didcot, Oxfordshire - all believed to be owned by the same person - were visited on Thursday evening.

Thirteen of those arrested have been detained pending removal from the UK. Three others have been placed on immigration bail.

They will be removed from the UK if found to have no leave to remain.

Three other men found working illegally at one of the premises in Broadway were not arrested, but must report regularly to the Home Office while their cases are progressed.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23535938,Two-thirds of fines for illegal workers uncollected,2013,"Illegal working operation: A previous raid in London

Two-thirds of fines imposed on employers of illegal workers have been uncollected in the past five years, the BBC has learnt.

A Freedom of Information request found the Home Office had issued almost Â£80m in fines but collected Â£25m.

Restaurants and take-aways incurred the most fines - more than Â£55m.

Meanwhile, immigration enforcement officers have been taking part in 200 raids and have arrested 101 suspected illegal immigrants across the country.

The Home Office has been running the major illegal workers crackdown.

The data on fines collected by BBC News relates to the civil penalty system through which the Home Office can fine an employer up to Â£10,000 if they are found to have an illegal immigrant on their books.

The figures show that more than 8,500 penalties totalling Â£79,300,000 were issued between 2008/09 and 2012/13, but two-thirds of that total remains uncollected.

In the first year that the fines system was in operation, there were Â£16.7m in fines - but only Â£1.3m of that was collected. Since then, the amount collected has increased to more than Â£6m a year.

The businesses that have received the most penalties include restaurants, take-aways, car washes, factories, food producers and small shops. More than 150 supermarkets were also fined for having illegal workers.

In its response to the BBC's FOI request, the Home Office said some of the original fines may have been reduced or cancelled after appeals. Some employers may have also gone out of business - while others could have asked to pay in instalments.

A Home Office spokesman said: ""The government is determined to take effective action to reduce illegal migration, and to tackle illegal working. Giving employers hefty fines if they employ illegal immigrants is a key part of this.

""As part of our upcoming Immigration Bill, we will take even tougher action against businesses which use illegal labour and will double the fines levied against rogue employers. The Bill will also strengthen our ability to enforce unpaid fines.""

In the last financial year, there were more than 5,000 illegal workers operations resulting in some 4,500 arrests.

Speaking about Thursday's enforcement operations, immigration minister Mark Harper said: ""Today's arrests highlight the routine work we are carrying out every day to stamp out illegal working.

""We are sending a clear message to employers who choose to use illegal labour: we will find you and you will pay a heavy penalty.

""Illegal working undercuts legitimate businesses and is often linked to exploitative behaviour such as tax evasion and harmful working conditions. We will not allow the growth of a shadow economy for illegal migrants.""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2468q3y75vo,US accused of using illegal workers at centre processing refugee claims in South Africa,2025,"The US has prioritised white South Africans despite reducing overall refugee numbers

South Africa has accused the US of using Kenyan nationals withoutwork permits at a facility processing applications by white South Africans for refugee status.

Seven Kenyans were arrested after intelligence reports revealed that people ""had recently entered South Africa on tourist visas and had illegally taken up work"" at the centre, said a statement from South Africa's department of home affairs.

The US responded by accusing South Africa of ""interference"" in its efforts to admit white Afrikaners as refugees.

The US is offering asylum status to Afrikaners as it says the community is facing persecution. South Africa's government has rejected the claims.

The US has reduced its yearly intake of refugees from around the world from 125,000 to 7,500, but says it will prioritise Afrikaners, who are mostly descendants of Dutch and French settlers.

This is one of the issues that have caused a sharp deterioration in relations between South Africa and the Trump administration.

South Africa says the Kenyan nationals arrested in Tuesday's raid will now be deported and will be banned from entering the country for five years.

They had previously been denied work visas but were found ""engaging in work despite only being in possession of tourist visas, in clear violation of their conditions of entry into the country"", the statement said.

South Africa also expressed concern that foreign officials appeared to have coordinated with undocumented workers and said it had reached out to the US and Kenya to resolve the matter.

The home affairs department said the raid showcased the commitment that South Africa shared ""with the United States to combating illegal immigration and visa abuse in all its forms"".

In a statement issued on Thursday, the US State Department said it condemned ""in the strongest terms the South African government's recent detention of US officials performing their duties to provide humanitarian support to Afrikaners"".

It also accused South Africa of releasing the passport information of its officials, which it called ""an unacceptable form of harassment"" and an attempt to intimidate them.

South Africa has rejected this allegation, saying it treats ""data security with the utmost seriousness"".

In its statement on Wednesday, it said that no US officials were arrested and the operation was not at a diplomatic site.

The processing of applications by white South Africans is being done by RSC Africa, according to the US embassy in South Africa. RSC Africa is a Kenyan-based refugee support centre operated by Church World Service (CWS).

The BBC has asked RSC Africa for comment.

US President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that Afrikaners are being subjected to a ""genocide"" in South Africa, even though there is no evidence that white farmers are more likely to be the victims of crime than their black counterparts.

He offered Afrikaners refugee status earlier this year after South African President Cyril Ramaphosa signed a law allowing the government to seize land without compensation in rare instances.

A first group of about 50 people flew to the US on a chartered plane - it is not clear how many others have moved, or are in the process of applying.

Because of the legacy of the racist apartheid system, the majority of privately owned farmland in South Africa is owned by the white community and South Africa's government is under pressure to provide more land to black farmers. However, it stresses that no land has yet been seized under the new law.

South Africa has repeatedly tried to mend fences with the Trump administration, most famously when Ramaphosa led a high-level delegation to the White House earlier this year.

However, this backfired whenTrump ambushed him with images, videos and news reportsallegedly showing that the government was persecuting white people.

One video featured firebrand South African opposition figure Julius Malema singing: ""Shoot the Boer [Afrikaner], Shoot the farmer"".

However, a South African court has ruled that this song, which Malema often chants at his political rallies, is not hate speech.

Last month, the US boycotted the G20 summit in South Africa and has said it would not invite South African officials to its meetings since it took over leadership of the grouping of the world's biggest economies.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y5379djl3o,Starmer considering digital ID scheme to tackle illegal migration,2025,"Starmer considering digital ID cards to tackle illegal immigration

Sir Keir Starmer has confirmed for the first time the government is looking at digital ID as a way to tackle illegal immigration.

The prime minister said a new identity programme could play an ""important part"" in reducing the incentive to enter the UK without permission.

He added things had ""moved on"" since the fraught debate over ID cards under the last Labour government in the mid-2000s.

But Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said: ""I think as a way of helping to control immigration, it is not really going to solve the problem.""

Speaking to political editor Chris Mason, Sir Keir said: ""We all carry a lot more digital ID now than we did 20 years ago, and I think that psychologically, it plays a different part.""

Asked whether a new scheme could play a role in reducing the attractiveness of the UK as a destination for illegal migrants, he added: ""My instinct is it can play an important part. Obviously we need to look through some of the detail.""

He added that, two decades on from the row over New Labour's physical ID card scheme, the public was likely to ""look differently"" at a digital-based scheme.

He did not confirm whether any new digital ID scheme would be mandatory.

By law, employers have to check that prospective candidates have the right to work in the UK.

Since 2022, they have been able to carry out checks on passport-holding British and Irish citizens by using digital verification services that have been certified by the government.

A Home Office online scheme also exists to verify the status of some non-British or Irish citizens, whose immigration status is held electronically.

It is understood officials are looking at whether requiring a digital ID could provide a more consistent approach to verifying identity.

They are also thought to be exploring whether the scheme could reduce the use of fake documents, and make it easier to target enforcement activity.

Sir Keir's comments are the most positive remarks yet by the prime minister about the idea, which is likely to reignite a debate over civil liberties.

Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden has visited Estonia recently to examine the Baltic state's extensive use of digital identity to allow citizens to access government and some private services such as medical records, voting and banking.

The government haspreviously rejecteda digital ID proposal suggested by former Labour Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair, whose government introduced plastic ID cards in the late 2000s.

Legislation to introduce the scheme was the subject of bitter clashes in the House of Lords, and plans to make them compulsory for UK citizens was later dropped.

Around 15,000 entered circulation but the scheme was scrapped, and database destroyed, by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in 2011.

Asked for the Tory position on digital ID, leader Kemi Badenoch said it would not help the government fulfil its pledge ""smash the gangs or stop the boats"".

""A lot of people who come to the country end up disappearing into the grey economy, or the black economy. and working illegally,"" she added.

There are sanctions including fines of up to Â£60,000 per unauthorised worker in cases where foreign workers are found to be working illegally.

For agency workers, the responsibility lies with the agency to conduct the relevant checks.

In March, the government announced the requirement to conduct a testwould be extendedto self-employed contractors carrying out work on behalf of a company.

Currently, firms are responsible for conducting checks on such workers only if they have sponsored the visa allowing them to work in the UK.

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper argued the extension would help enforcement in the so-called gig economy, where many workers are employed in temporary or casual roles.

In July, French President Emmanuel Macron said the UK had agreed to address the ""fight against illegal work"" as part of pull factors attracting illegal migrants.

The government has also been under pressure to find alternative living arrangements for around 32,000 asylum seekers currently living in taxpayer-funded hotels whilst their claims are processed.

Ministers have promised to stop using hotels to house asylum seekers by the time of the next election, due by 2029.

Sir Keir said he had asked officials at the Home Office and Ministry of Defence to ""work at pace"" to identify military sites that could be used to provide alternative accommodation.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clydd7zeye7o,US judge says mass firings of some federal workers likely illegal,2025,"A California judge has said the mass firings of probationary employees by the Trump administration were likely unlawful.

The ruling said the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) had told thousands of employees across a handful of federal agencies they were fired using authority the agency does not have, US District Judge William Alsup ruled.

""[OPM] does not have any authority whatsoever, under any statute in the history of the universe, to hire and fire employees at another agency,"" he said. ""They can hire and fire their own employees.""

In court the government argued OPM asked, not ordered, the agencies to fire these employees.

They also argued that probationary employees are not guaranteed employment and that only the highest performing and mission-critical employees should be hired.

Government workers have been the target of the Trump administration's efforts to reduce the federal workforce in the name of cutting costs.

Many employees affected by the firings are probationary employees - usually those in their first or second year in a job - though they can sometimes be long-time employees who were recently promoted.

There are some 200,000 probationary employees in the federal workforce.

Judge Alsup ordered OPM to revoke its directives to multiples agencies - including the Department of Veterans Affairs, the National Park Service, and the Defence Department - to terminate employees.

He issued a temporary restraining order which puts a momentary pause on the government's actions until a judge revisits the matter in the coming weeks.

The case began after a coalition of labour unions and non-profit organisations sued the government, arguing OPM unlawfully fired individuals by falsely claiming workers were performing poorly.

Everett Kelley, the National President of the American Federation of Government Employees, called the ruling a victory for Americans were were ""illegally fired"" from their jobs by an agency with ""no authority to do so"".

""These are rank-and-file workers who joined the federal government to make a difference in their communities, only to be suddenly terminated due to this administration's disdain for federal employees and desire to privatize their work,"" he said.

An Indian restaurant was temporarily shut down after three men were found to be working there illegally.

Red Rose, in Clevedon, has been handed a six-month court order following a visit by the Home Office's Immigration Enforcement team on 12 April.

Enquiries found three men from Bangladesh, who had no right to work in the UK, were being employed. Despite attempting to evade officers by running out of the back of the restaurant, they were detained and arrested, the enforcement team said.

Taunton Magistrates' Court heard on 16 April how officers had visited the premises twice before and it had previously been issued with a Â£30,000 fine for hiring illegal workers.

The six-month compliance order means officers will closely monitor the business, including through monthly visits, to ensure it is complying with immigration rules.

It also requires the business owner to provide immigration officers with employment documentation when requested.

Aimee Langston, chief immigration officer at the West of England Immigration and Customs Enforcement Team, said: ""I hope this compliance order sends a clear message that we will continue to pursue businesses suspected of breaking immigration rules.

""It is a legal requirement to carry out right to work checks on employees and those who disregard the law and the integrity of our immigration system will face the full consequences.""

Immigration enforcement teams have carried out 6,784 illegal working visits to premises and made 4,779 arrests since July 2024 â an increase of 40% and 42% respectively - compared to the same period 12 months ago.

Twelve men and a woman were arrested in north Wales on 19 March.

FP McCann, a concrete supplier based in County Londonderry, has been referred for a penalty of up to Â£225,000 for employing five illegal contractors.

Adana Construction, from Stockport, has been referred for a penalty of up to Â£180,000 for employing four illegal workers.

""Illegal working causes untold harm to communities, puts vulnerable people at risk, defrauds the public purse and undercuts honest employers and jobseekers, HM Insp Ryan Moore said.

""This operation was a huge success and I thank our officers who executed it expertly"".

The Home Office said the operation at the former paper mill where the workers were arrested was launched in response to concerns raised by the public.

Shotton Mill is being converted to a containerboard factory.

The 13 people arrested were working as subcontracted labourers and steel-fixers.  The Home Office said they would now be removed from the UK.

Both companies were issued with civil penalty referral notices, pending a review of evidence from the site visit and company records.

Under the civil penalty process, a referral notice is issued if officials determine they have found illegal workers and there is no statutory excuse for employing them.

At that stage the company can provide further evidence that it wants to be taken into account when determining liability and the level of any penalty.

The civil penalty can also be challenged in court. Fines for employing illegal workers were significantly increased in February.

The maximum civil penalty for a first breach increased from Â£15,000 a worker to Â£45,000 a worker.

Immigration officers found the three workers at Exotic Karahi in Farnham Road, Slough, during a visit in September 2024.

They were identified as immigration offenders and reported receiving free food in exchange for their labour during an interview.

A Slough Borough Council meeting heard this could have amounted to ""modern-day slavery"".

Exotic Sweet Centre Limited, which trades as Exotic Karahi, received the civil penalty for employing two people who did not have the right to work in the UK in November.

The Home Office then requested a review of the business's premises licence in June, on the grounds its ""prevention of crime and disorder"" conditions had not been met - a view supported by Thames Valley Police, councillors heard.

The Home Office said the licence holder and management had ""failed to conduct mandatory employment checks to prevent illegal working"".

Caroline Laird, a Home Office immigration enforcement officer, said: ""[The workers] were paid by way of food, which, obviously is also a way of going unnoticed and promoting working for nothing really, as they don't have any other means of gaining lawful employment in the UK.""

Sub-chair of the committee, councillor Mohammed Nazir, asked: ""In other words, they could have been constituted as slave labour?""

Ms Laird replied: ""Yes, modern-day slavery.""

Restaurant owner, Inderpaul Roa, told councillors he was diagnosed with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS) and recovering at the time of the raid.

He said: ""I was literally paralysed and so I was in hospital. This sort of happened over night.""

He said a manager was hired during this time, and oversaw hiring workers and overseeing their immigration status. The manager was fired following the case.

Surendra Panchal, the legal representative of Mr Rao and his son Deep Singh Rao, said: ""We are not running away from the mistake that was caused at the premises.

""We have explained to you why those mistakes were happening, and we've learned a lesson from it.""

The restaurant will still be able to sell food and soft drinks until 23:00 BST.

Koloshi Indian Restaurant on London Road had its premises licence reviewed and revoked by Cheltenham Borough Council this week.

The restaurant previously had a licence to sell alcohol every day from 09:00 to midnight.

However, the Home Office requested a review of its licence in April.

Legal representatives for the licensee told the licensing sub-committee on 11 October he could not comment on what the Home Office representatives said in relation to the raid and the finding of illegal workers there.

His client has not had any issues with illegal working in 25 years of being in the industry, he said.

""He appreciates the damage that it does to the country and the people. It is a bona fide change of ownership.""

Licensing chairman David Willingham said the committee was unanimous in its decision to revoke the premises' licence.

""Six workers with immigration issues suggest complicity in providing work for trafficked individuals. This raises questions over exploitation, failure to pay national insurance and tax and national minimum wage.""

A row over whether removal targets were or weren't being used by the Home Office became the latest in a series of unknowns, from exactly how many people might have been affected to whether other communities could find themselves in the same position.

Home Secretary Amber Rudd on Wednesday insisted immigration removal targets did not exist, before later confirming that they had been used for ""internal performance management"".  Aleaked memohas since suggested she was told of their existence.

Lucy Moreton, general secretary of the Immigration Services Union, told BBC Reality Check that every civil service department sets targets against which it measures its performance. Problems only arose because of a ""pressure to detect and remove as many people as we possibly can"", she said.

Immigration removal targets 'to be axed'

Could you prove you've been living in the UK?

Laws introduced over the past five years were designed to create a ""hostile environment"" for illegal immigrants - but it has become clear over the past weeks that some people living here legally have fallen foul of these measures because they don't have the right paperwork.

Ms Rudd told Parliament on Thursday that: ""Everyone in this House agrees that this group were here legally, but also that people who are here illegally should be treated differently from legal migrants.""

Private landlords are required to check the immigration status of their tenants, under a rule known as ""right to rent""

The NHS also has to carry out checks as part of its legal duty to identify and charge patients who don't qualify for free medical care for their treatment

The Home Office has been given greater powers to investigate and prevent ""sham marriages""

The driving licence authority has been given powers to restrict migrants' access to licences

Banks and building societies must conduct checks of the immigration status of their customers

Employers have to check their workers' immigration status and can face large fines or even prison

Despite these policies and removal targets, the number of removals and detentions has been falling.

Part of the intention of these policies was to make life difficult enough for people living in the UK illegally so that they would leave of their own accord.

But Ms Moreton says the falling number of detentions and removals is partly explained by cuts to the number of spaces in detention centres which mean people can't be detained, and then abscond before they can be deported.

Appearing before a select committee, Home Secretary Amber Rudd denies there are targets

She adds this drives more people into the ""grey economy"" - informal or illegal work that doesn't get captured in official statistics - meaning they vanish from the system and become more difficult to find. In these cases, the policy may be having the opposite of its intended effect.

David Bolt, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, said in a 2014 report that there was ""insufficient hard evidence to say whether they were achieving what the government intended"".

He added that the justification for extending these powers in 2016 was ""based on a conviction that they are 'right' in principle"" rather than on any evidence they were working.

In a report published last month, he said that the ""right to rent"" scheme requiring landlords to check their tenants' immigration status had ""yet to demonstrate its worth"" and was potentially discriminatory.

And, in a review of exit checks, he warned that major gaps in the data meant ""presenting exit checks as the answer to managing the illegal migrant population"" at the moment ""remains wishful thinking"".

Landlords are legally obliged to check the immigration status of their tenants

Exit checks were stopped in 1998 and reinstated in 2015.

Now most people are being counted in and out, but there are particular groups of people it's difficult to track, like those travelling by coach or ferry, or leaving via the Common Travel Area with Ireland.

The system works by matching millions of records of arrivals and departures at the border to create ""identities"" of people.

As of last March, there were 600,000 people who should have left the country for whom there was no record of their departure.

It is not possible to know exactly how many illegal immigrants are in the UK. By definition, those who are in the country illegally evade authorities in order to remain undetected. This means illegal immigrants don't generally show up in the statistics unless they are detected and removed.

But some attempts have been made to estimate the total size of this population putting the figure anywhere between300,000,externalandmore than a million.,external

Like all the studies to date, it only serves as an estimate of what is by nature a hidden population.

Figures on deportations and detentions alone don't provide us with evidence that the policy is  achieving its aims - in fact, they are falling.

But those people who leave voluntarily, perhaps dissuaded by the toughening up of immigration rules, may never be captured in any figures.

They also don't capture the ""pull factor"" - people who may have come to the UK but have been deterred - making it difficult to assess how effective the hostile environment policies have been.",England,Scotland

The Home Office says the group are among 171 riders arrested over seven days in November in a national ""enforcement blitz"" in villages, towns and cities across the country.

It comes as Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has been targeting people working unlawfully in the ""gig economy"".

Border Security Minister Alex Norris has also met representatives from food-delivery firms to encourage them to do more to tackle the issue - such as using facial recognition checks to prevent riders sharing their identities with people who do not have permission to take up work in the UK.

Norris said November's action ought to ""send a clear message: if you are working illegally in this country, you will be arrested and removed"".

He added: ""We are tightening the law to clamp down on illegal working in the delivery sector to root out this criminality from our communities.""

The Home Office highlighted the cases of two Chinese nationals arrested at a restaurant in Solihull, four riders of Bangladeshi and Indian nationality in Newham, east London, and three riders of Indian nationality in Norwich. Seven of them were ""detained for removal"", it said.

Asylum seekers are generally not allowed to undertake paid work during their first 12 months in the UK, or until their asylum application is approved.

But earlier this year the Sun newspaper reported that Channel migrants were able to rent accounts from legitimate delivery firm workers via social media groups.

The government said at the time that ""illicit account sharing"" had been facilitating illegal work.

The Home Office says it has recently been sharing the locations of asylum hotels with food delivery companies so they can ""monitor hotspots for illegal working"".

Deliveroo, Just Eat and Uber Eats say they have increased randomised facial checks to ensure riders match their account names.

The Home Office added in a statement that it had made 8,000 arrests last year for illegal working - a 63% rise on the previous 12 months.

The Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill introduces new laws to expand right to work checks to the gig economy, including on delivery riders.

Though asylum seekers cannot work in the UK during their first 12 months in the country, they are allowed to volunteer.

The bill, to be introduced in the autumn, will also contain measures against takeaway restaurants and off-licences which employ illegal migrants.

Penalties will also include an unlimited fine and wages being seized.

Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said the government ""would continue to crack down on abuse"" of the system.

The government has made a series of immigration announcements over the summer of which this is the latest.

Takeaways and off-licences could lose their licences if they were found to be employing illegal workers.

Officials are also considering whether this provision should be extended to cover minicab drivers and operators.

The legal defence for other kinds of business discovered using illegal workers will also change.

They will no longer be able to claim they did not know a particular employee was not allowed to work - they will have to show that they carried out proper checks before taking them on.

The maximum sentence for employers found guilty will be raised from two to five years, in addition to the fines already in force.

Mr Brokenshire said: ""Anyone who thinks the UK is a soft touch should be in no doubt - if you are here illegally, we will take action to stop you from working, renting a flat, opening a bank account or driving a car.

""As a one nation government we will continue to crack down on abuse and build an immigration system that works in the best interests of the British people and those who play by the rules.""

James Brokenshire says people in the UK illegally will face measures to stop them working

Alp Mehmet, of Migration Watch UK, which supports tighter immigration controls, said: ""This is not just about not being seen as a soft touch.

""More important is for the message to go out that if you are here illegally and caught working, you and your employer will end up in court.

""Let us hope that the authorities will not shy away from acting on the powers they are to be given, since their record on that front has not always been exemplary.""

Earlier this month, the government also announced thatlandlords in England will be expected to evict tenantswho lose the right to live in the UK, also under the proposed Immigration Bill.

Landlords will be able to end tenancies, sometimes without a court order, when asylum requests fail, and will be required to check a migrant's status in advance of agreeing a lease. Repeat offenders could face up to five years in prison.

A couple who ran a nursing agency with lucrative public sector contracts recruited dozens of illegal workers from overseas, a jury has been told.

Mahendrasing Caussyram, 51, and his wife Saraspedy, 54, are alleged to have hired 52 carers who worked illegally in the UK for CareFirst 24.

The agency was paid almost Â£500,000 by Sutton Council for care services over six years, Croydon Crown Court heard.

Workers were paid Â£450 a week for providing 24-hour home care.

The court was told CareFirst 24 provided services for Woking and Walton hospitals in Surrey, Surrey Primary Care Trust and Surrey County Council as well as Merton and Sutton councils in south London.

Mr and Mrs Caussyram received ""significant income"" as directors of the Sutton-based company, which was registered with regulator the Care Quality Commission (CQC), the court heard.

""Many of the carers sub-contracted by CareFirst 24 were overseas nationals from countries outside the European Union, in particular the Philippines - in other words, migrants,"" said prosecutor Andrew Evans.

""The rate of pay which carers were paid was not particularly good. Neither were the hours.

""In some cases they continued to work after their visas expired. They were what the Home Office terms as illegal overstayers.

""If local authorities had known that CareFirst 24 was providing services via carers not working lawfully in the UK ... those services would have terminated and no further payment made.""

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, said: ""Those found to be illegally working in beauty salons, car washes and as delivery drivers will be arrested, detained and removed from this country"".

Arrests in Wales included seven Chinese nationals at a construction site on the Gower earlier this month.

There were three illegal working arrests at a barbers in Porthmadog last month and a visits to warehouses in Caldicot in August resulted in eight illegal working arrests.

There was a 95% rise in the number of illegal working visits in Wales by enforcement officers.

The nationwide operation resulted in more than 1,050 foreign nationals being removed from the UK over the same period.

The UK government said it was ""expanding right-to-work checks"" into the so-called gig economy ""where there are higher levels of illegal migrants seeking work"".

Its Â£5m crackdown targeted businesses who often rely on casual or temporary workers, including fast food takeaways, beauty salons and car washes.

The council was told Mr Ali had been fined Â£35,000 in 2019 for employing illegal workers at the 50-seat eatery after he showed no evidence that he made any checks on the eligibility of workers.

A Home Office immigration enforcement officer told councillors the ability to work without authorisation, as Mr Ali had allowed to happen, is a key driver of illegal migration, theLocal Democracy Reporting Service said.

In evidence Lyndsay Grant, 46, said she was to find out if dentistry work was taking place on the premises and ""if there was any fingers being inserted in to the mouth - wet work"".

She told procurator fiscal depute Mhairi Alexander she had taken her mum, who had a problem with her plate, to see Nicol - who had offered to make a new plate or to fix the current one.

He went away to do what she thought was prepare to make impressions.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49710817,Illegal work practices 'far too common' says think tank study,2019,"Young people are least likely to seek redress through employment tribunals

About one in 20 workers does not get paid holidays, while one in 10 does not get a payslip, according to a report by the Resolution Foundation think tank.

It found workers over the age of 65 are most likely to not have paid holidays, despite a legal entitlement to 28 days a year, or pro-rota for part-timers.

And workers aged 25 and under are twice as likely to be underpaid the minimum wage that any other age group.

The think tank says its findings reveal the extent of illegal labour practices.

Workers in hotels and restaurants miss out out more than others on legal workplace entitlements, the report says.

Meanwhile, those in small firms, employing fewer than 25, are most likely to not get payslips and paid leave, as are workers on zero-hours and temporary contracts, the Resolution Foundation said.

The analysis was published to mark the start of the organisation's three-year investigation into the enforcement of labour market rules and regulations.

Lindsay Judge, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""The UK has a multitude of rules to govern its labour market, from maximum hours to minimum pay, but these rules can only become a reality if they are properly enforced.

""Labour market violations remain far too common, with millions of workers missing out on basic entitlements to a payslip, holiday entitlement and the minimum wage.

""Our analysis suggests that, while violations take place across the labour market, the government should also prioritise investigations into sectors like hotels and restaurants, along with firms who make large use of atypical employment contracts, as that's where abuse is most prevalent,"" Ms Judge said.

She welcomed the government's move to strengthen the resources and powers of bodies such as HM Revenue & Customs and the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Agency.

However, the UK still largely relies on individuals seeking redress through the Employment Tribunal (ET) system. And, she said, many of the individuals in most need of help to challenge illegal practices are those least likely to use ETs.

Young people are disproportionately subjected to unlawful working practises, but make fewer ET applications than any other age group.

In contrast, managerial staff are least likely to be subject to labour market abuse, but are among the most likely to be make tribunal claims.

The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it is committed to enforcing workplace regulations and tackling firms that break the rules, and is consulting on bringing agencies together under its proposed Single Enforcement Body.

""We are extending state enforcement to cover holiday pay for vulnerable workers, as part of the largest upgrade to workers' rights in a generation,"" said a spokesman.

However, Shadow business minister Laura Pidcock said she recognised many people worked in illegal conditions, but insisted ""the Tories are on the side of the few, not the many"".

""Behind these statistics are many hours of stressful and exhausting work, people's home lives being made so much harder than they need to be, an unchecked class of bad bosses and legions of workers who feel like they have no choice but to accept illegal poor conditions,"" she said.

An Albanian national who travelled to the UK illegally has told the BBC how his life became ""unbearable"" after he ended up working on a cannabis farm.

Gzim, who wished to remain anonymous, was one of more than 12,600 Albanians who made the trip to the UK by small boat in 2022 - the peak year forEnglish Channel migrant crossings.

Last year the number of Albanians that made the dangerous journey dropped to just 616 people, following a campaign by the UK and Albanian governments.

Gzim says he is speaking out to warn others, as the UK government relaunches a social media campaign aimed at warning Albanians who enter illegally of possible hardships in the UK.

He says he found a smuggler on TikTok who agreed to help him make the journey to England, and after travelling to France via buses, he arrived in Dunkirk, where a boat was launched to Dover.

He says his cousins, who were already in the UK, paid the smuggler Â£3,500 for him to cross the channel.

After being placed in a hotel, he says he was able to leave unnoticed to work on a cannabis farm.

He said: ""I wanted a better life, to help my family, like all the other people who have done this journey.

""I knew the risks involved with this kind of business, but I hoped that I wouldn't be unlucky.""

For some time, the northern Albanian city of KukÃ«s was known as a 'ghost town' because many left for the UK

He says the cannabis farm was broken into and because of this he didn't get paid.

Gzim moved into a construction role where he says he felt forced to take a lower wage - not enough to cover his own expenses and support his family back home.

Five months after arriving in the UK he said it got so ""unbearable"" he decided to return to Albania.

He added: ""I dreamed of other things. I hoped I would make it.

""Nobody wants to leave his homeland. Nobody wants to leave his people and his friends. But in Albania it is a war of survival and I didn't have any other choice.""

How many people cross the Channel in small boats

Newsocial media,externaladverts are highlighting stories of migrants who entered the UK illegally ""only to face debt and exploitation"".

This approach originally started in 2023 under the Conservative government.

It followeda cooperation agreement,externalsigned by the UK and Albania under the previous government to try and reduce illegal migration.

The numbers on small boats had already started to fall before the agreement was struck.

The National Crime Agency said the reduction in crossings is due toa number of different factors,external, including law enforcement activity, deportations, diminished demand for travel to the UK and potential displacement to other methods.

Last year more than 2,600 people were returned to Albania, more than any other nationality.

Lavdrim Krashi is an MP in the ruling Socialist Party

Balkans expert Andi Hoxhaj told a committee of MPs in 2022 that he estimated about 40% of people leave Albania for ""economic opportunities"".

Lavdrim Krashi, an MP in the ruling Socialist Party, said some people had been lured on social media by promises of a better life in Britain.

He told the BBC: ""The promotion was made to especially young people to come to the UK and if you make it there, don't worry about any finances because money really grows on trees, and we know that's not the case.

""The numbers travelling illegally has drastically reduced in the last few years, but always more can be done,"" he said.

""It's not in our interest to lose our young people, we want to make them thrive in the Albanian economy.""

But there are also ongoing concerns about Albanians being trafficked into the UK.

They are still among the most common nationalities referred to theNational Referral Mechanism,externalas potential modern day slaves.

The food delivery companies agreed to increase facial verification and fraud checks in a bid to stop people with no right to work in the UK from using someone else's account to earn money illegally.

Asylum seekers are not allowed to work for the first 12 months of being in the UK, or until their asylum application is approved.

But concerns have been raised that some migrants staying in government asylum hotels have been earning money on the apps.

The government said there was ""illicit account sharing"" enabling people to work for the firms illegally.

It said Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just Eat had now agreed to ""increase the use of facial verification checks and fraud detection technology"" to ensure only registered account holders could work off their platforms.

Deliveroo and Uber Eats will increase the quantity and sophistication of verification checks they do already, and Just Eat will carry out checks on a daily rather than monthly basis.

The government said the new checks would come into force over the next 90 days.

""This government will not turn a blind eye to illegal working,"" said Dame Angela Eagle, minister for border security and asylum.

""It undercuts honest business, hits people's wages and plays into the hands of the people smuggling gangs.""

Over the last year, Deliveroo, Uber Eats, and Just Eat have introduced voluntary right-to-work checks on all account holders and registered so-called ""substitute"" drivers, but ministers have raised concerns that there continued to be abuse in the sector.

Last week, The Sun newspaper reported that Channel migrants were able to rent out other people's Deliveroo and Just Eat delivery accounts via social media groups.

It claimed asylum seekers had been earning up to Â£1,000 a week on the apps and found dozens of online forums where legal riders were sub-letting their accounts for as little as Â£40 a week.

Ministers met with the three firms on Monday following the reports.

A Deliveroo spokesperson said the company took a ""zero tolerance approach to anyone abusing our platform"" and said it was ""committed to further strengthening our approach, increasing daily facial recognition checks"".

Uber Eats said it would ""continue to invest in industry-leading tools to detect illegal work and remove fraudulent accounts"", while Just Eat added it was ""continuing to invest significant resources to protect the integrity of our network"".

In March, the government announced that companies hiring people in the gig economy would be legally required to carry out checks, confirming that anyone working in their name is eligible to work in the UK, bringing them in line with other employers.

If businesses fail to carry out such checks, they could face hefty penalties, including fines of up to Â£60,000 per worker, business closures, director disqualifications and potential prison sentences of up to five years.",UK,

Mr Gigaba warned that firms would be ""penalised"" if they breached the law, and said they should not fuel tensions by ""playing locals against foreigners"".

His comments come amid concern that xenophobia is rising in South Africa.

Many unemployed South Africans accuse foreigners of taking their jobs.

Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories

In the past week, Nigerian nationals have been attacked in the capital Pretoria; on Monday, 34 foreign-owned shops were looted in parts of Pretoria, and a local group has called for a march for Friday to protest at immigrants it says are taking their jobs.

The attacks triggered condemnation by the Nigerian government and a call by MPs for Nigeria's ambassador to South Africa to be recalled.

But South Africa's foreign affairs department dismissed claims that Nigerian nationals were targets of xenophobic violence.

Spokesperson Clayson Monyela said the attacks were nothing more than sporadic criminal incidents. The government also said inflammatory social media statements by South Africans and foreign nationals against each other were unnecessary.

However, Thursday saw protesters in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, target the head office of South African telecoms company MTN in apparent retaliation for violence against Nigerians in South Africa.

Police are guarding the MTN head office in Abuja after it was targeted by protesters

Mr Gigaba, whose comments have been published on the government's Twitter account, said South Africans should not be portrayed as ""mere xenophobes"".

He added that 33,339 people had been deported in 2015-16.

South Africa's Home Affairs Department is getting tough on business - but will it work? The sense in some circles is it'll be all talk and no action - purely because they aren't enough people to carry out the job.  The country is among the top 10 picks in the world for migrants looking for safety or a fresh start, according to the office of the president.

In the spirit of ""Ubuntu""- humanity - South Africa has been hard-pressed to turn away its neighbours when they came knocking in their millions over the years. So what's the problem? Businesses have been accused of taking advantage of the situation by hiring illegal immigrants as cheap labour to avoid complying with government policy of fair pay.

This is partly where the ""foreigners are taking our jobs sentiment"" touted at the moment comes from. But the government can't afford to not act - those frustrated with the challenges presented by the country's porous borders are taking to violence to get their voices heard and making like difficult for foreigners living in their communities.

Still, the current trend of migration is placing additional pressure on the already struggling economy and something has got to give. While some are calling for stricter laws altogether, a more immediate response could be a more careful vetting of who is in the country and why. Are they actual asylum seekers or economic migrants - with the latter more likely to get caught in the eye of the storm.

In his budget speech on Wednesday, South African Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said that 35% of the labour force was unemployed or had given up looking for work.

Andrzej Harytczak was prosecuted by the Environment Agency (EA) after he was found operating a site without the necessary permits in Tranker Lane, Worksop, in 2017 and 2019.

The 38-year-old, of Yeoman Close in Worksop, admitted two breaches of the Environmental Permitting (England & Wales) Regulations 2016.

Asylum seekers are working illegally out of desperation as they wait months to find out if they can stay in the UK, it has been claimed.

One man said worrying if he would be deported left him thinking ""what is the point in life"".

""You can't sleep, you can't eat,"" said the man, who joined calls for asylum seekers to be able to work while their appeals are heard.

It comes after one worker fell to his death during a raid in Newport.

But the Home Office said the rules, which mean asylum seekers are not allowed to work in the UK, were to protect the resident labour market and asylum seekers could get support until their appeal was determined.

Mustafa Dawood, 23, had been working at a car wash in the Newport while his appeal was being considered butfell from a roof while fleeing from immigration officers in June.

BBC Wales spoke to one man in Newport, who does not wish to be named, who said he thought he had been ""forgotten"" by the Home Office as his last contact was in late 2016.

""Mustafa, like me had been waiting, he got work, he needed money to buy some stuff.

""If I was able to work it would be better, it would be better than being stuck at home in the same routine, it would take my mind off the decision.

""You can't sleep, you can't eat, it's hard. Sometimes I think about crazy stuff. I think why do I stay in this life. I think, what is the point in life?

""Other people are worse than me, my friends, when we walk together they keep talking about killing themselves.""

He added: ""I hope the Home Office will change these kind of rules and allow people to work and to answer people more quickly, not take one or two years.

According to the Wales Strategic Migration Partnership there were 2,910 asylum seekers in Wales receiving some form of support in the first quarter of 2018.

The asylum seeker said he and others were having to wait years to find out if they would be deported

Managers at the Sanctuary Project, which supports asylum seekers, believe Mr Dawood would still be alive if he had been able to work legally.

Project manager Sarah Croft said: ""Mustafa shouldn't have been working, we know that. But honestly this system drives people to make bad choices.

""Had Mustafa been told you can go to work legally, then he wouldn't have been fearful of those authorities when they arrived.

""I would like to see asylum seekers be given the right to work if the Home Office can't meet their guidelines.

""Maybe limited hours, but it would improve their mental health. Many of the people who use our service are accessing primary mental health services and, maybe this could be alleviated were they given the right to work.""

Home Office guidelines state an asylum decision on straightforward cases ""will usually be decided within six months"".

However support workers at The Sanctuary said ""few"" people are given a decision within this period, with some having to wait years.

The Irish government announced in June that asylum seekers waiting longer than nine months for a decision will be allowed to work, with few restrictions on the type of employment.

The Sanctuary said it has the support of other organisations across the UK and will be writing to Home Secretary Sajid Javid about following suit.

A Home Office spokesman said: ""Asylum seekers are not allowed to work in the UK unless their claim has been outstanding for at least 12 months through no fault of their own.

""This policy is designed to protect the resident labour market to prioritise access employment for British citizens and those lawfully resident here, including those granted refugees status.

Essex-based construction company OKE Development Ltd was fined Â£320,000 for illegal employment at the former MandM Direct building on Clinton Road, Leominster, according to the document.

The report states additionally that Care recruitment firm Lord's Care Hereford Ltd, of Rotherwas Industrial Estate, was fined Â£10,000, although it is unclear where the illegal workers were deployed.

The latest summary from Immigration Enforcement was published on 29 August but covers the first quarter of this year. Both firms have declined to comment.

OKE has since gone into liquidation, filings at Companies House show.

Immigration Enforcement explains that the addresses given in its reports are either that of the business where the enforcement visit took place, or in the absence of such a visit, the registered address of the liable party.

The report does not state the nationality of the workers in question.

A convenience store where officials said they found an illegal worker faces being stripped of its licence to sell alcohol.

Hillside Stores in Kinson Road, Bournemouth, was raided by immigration officials on 7 November 2024, when an Indian man who had no right to work in the UK was found behind the counter.

Dorset Police will apply to revoke the store's premises licence at a Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council (BCP) meeting on Wednesday.

Sujeevan Muralimohan, who is responsible for the shop's premises licence, told BCP that he was ""committed to upholding all legal and licensing obligations"".

The man found working illegally at the business said he had started working there in mid-October 2024.

Officials found he entered the UK on a student visa in 2022 but failed to enrol on his course.

That led to his visa being curtailed, making him an overstayer with no right to work in the UK.

The business was issued with a fine of Â£40,000 in January, an immigration official said in BCP papers published ahead of Wednesday's meeting.

Mr Muralimohan said the fine was cut to Â£5,000 ""in recognition of my full cooperation with the investigation"".

He said he has held a premises licence since 2011 and has ""operated in full compliance with licensing regulations throughout this period, with no prior remarks or violations"".

Dorset Police will say on Wednesday that it â along with other authorities â ""no longer have confidence in [Mr Muralimohan] to uphold the licensing objectives"".

According to the council documents, the force will also say it was ""particularly concerned"" nitrous oxide canisters were found at the shop.

Nitrous oxide has been classified as a class C drug ""where its intended use is not legitimate and likely to be used to inhale"", said police.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwy7xqwqxxxo,"Work checks can cut illegal migration, says Cooper",2025,"The home secretary has said plans for new checks on unauthorised working will help cut levels of illegal migration.

Yvette Cooper has announced plans to expand the range of companies that can be fined for not carrying out right-to-work checks on casual workers.

Speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, she said criminal gangs were using the prospect of illegal work to lure people into trying to enter the country.

It comes ahead of a UK-hosted summit on Monday, to be attended by about 40 nations, on tackling organised immigration crime.

Conservative shadow minister Alex Burghart said his party would study the proposals, but Labour needed to do more to deter people from coming to the UK.

Companies have a legal responsibility to verify that people they employ directly have the right to work in the UK. For agency workers, the responsibility lies with the agency to conduct the relevant checks.

There are sanctions including fines of up to Â£60,000 per unauthorised worker in cases where foreign workers are found to be working illegally.

Under plans announced on Sunday, the requirement to conduct a test would be extended to self-employed contractors carrying out work on behalf of a company.

Currently, firms are responsible for conducting checks on such workers only if they have sponsored the visa allowing them to work in the UK.

Cooper told the BBC that checks were currently ""not reaching"" the so-called gig economy, where many workers are employed in temporary or casual roles.

""Criminal gangs promise people illegal work just as they then take their money for illegal crossings as well,"" she added.

Asked how many illegal workers would be stopped under the new measures, she conceded it was ""difficult"" to provide a precise figure.

""What we need is for employers themselves to take action that prevents the illegal working in the first place,"" she added.

""Some of this is about us increasing enforcement, but some of this is the prevention action that we need employers to take.""

The Home Office said the change would be made possible by amending the government's Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill, which is making its way through Parliament.

The department said a ""full consultation"" with businesses on implementing the checks would then follow, naming construction, food delivery, beauty salons, and couriers among sectors likely to be affected by the new rules.

Elsewhere in her interview, Cooper confirmed the government is reviewing how international human rights law is applied to migration cases, although she did not provide details.

The government has faced pressure from the Conservatives, who havecalled for a law changeto stop those denied the right to stay in the UK challenging their deportation on human rights grounds.

Shadow cabinet office minister Burghart accused Labour ministers of looking at the ""wrong end of the problem"" when it came to illegal working.

He said Labour's decision to scrap the Tories'Rwanda deportation schemeshortly after entering office meant there would be no ""deterrent"" to stop people trying to enter the UK without permission.

The Conservatives announced the plan in 2022, but failed to bring the scheme into effect before they were voted out of office at last year's general election.",UK,
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-65929536,Birmingham raids in crackdown on illegal workers,2023,"An operation was carried out at a warehouse in Queslett

Twelve arrests have been made after immigration enforcement officers carried out raids in Birmingham as part of a crackdown on illegal workers.

Arrests included five males from Nova Services Group, the Home Office said, following an operation at a warehouse.

The BBC has asked the company - owner of the Queslett site - for comment.

Inspectors said among issues faced in the region were suspicions that foreign nationals were breaching student visa conditions by not attending courses.

The Home Office added that over the past year in the West Midlands, immigration enforcement teams had made more than 700 arrests, with only about half the individuals detained for deportation.

The warehouse was suspected of employing individuals who were working illegally

Of the Queslett leg of the operation on Thursday, HM Inspector Matt Foster, from Home Office Immigration Enforcement, said: ""We're looking that potentially these individuals are either not complying with the condition of the stay, i.e. they're not studying, or they're working in excess of 20 hours per week.

""[That] is prohibited on the visas that these individuals currently hold.""

Later the Home Office confirmed five males from India had been arrested, with a woman from the same nation held after a follow-up house search.

It added that of the five males, one was a student working in breach of rules and two were ""student overstayers"".

The firm was served with a civil penalty notice for a total potential fine of up to Â£100,000, the Home Office said.

HM Inspector Matt Foster said illegal working was ""rife across the UK""

There were also visits to two car washes in the city and a construction site.

In total, 12 arrests were made and there was ""a total civil penalty liability of Â£180,000"".

Mr Foster said: ""It's important that we protect the resident workforce and ensure that individuals are working legitimately and paying tax accordingly.""

The arrests were part of a series of nationally-coordinated operations.

This raids come as the Illegal Migration Bill goes through Parliament in a bid to curb the numbers of people arriving in the UK illegally.

Police have asked for the licence of a Blackpool takeaway to be revoked after a teenage girl was allegedly propositioned by a man working there illegally.

Lancashire Police received a report on 29 May that a man at the Tasty takeaway on The Strand offered to give an 18-year-old girl ""food for half price if she gave him a kiss or for free if she performed oral sex on him"".

The force has applied to a council licensing panel to strip the shop of its premises licence over the incident and for employing someone illegally.

Sgt Nat Cox of Lancashire Police said the alleged behaviour was ""extremely concerning"".

Blackpool Council's licensing panel has been asked by the force to revoke the licence due to the serious nature of the incident and the fact they were employing someone illegally.

The police ask that if the licence is not revoked, more stringent conditions should be added to the licence, theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicesaid.

The application, by Sgt Nat Cox of Lancashire Police said officers were called by the girl's mother at about 03:05 BST on 29 May.

The force said officers responded to a report that the 18-year-old had been assaulted, but after investigating they found she was propositioned ""following a dispute over payment"".

They discovered the takeaway worker had an asylum seeker ID card which confirmed he was not allowed to work in the UK after two failed asylum applications.

Sgt Cox in his report said police had ""significant concerns"" about this takeaway.

He said the shop had previously been warned about not having the door staff required under its licence and the alleged propositioning of the woman was ""particularly concerning"".

""A drunk 18-year-old female on her own late at night is extremely vulnerable,"" he said.

""She should be able to order food from a takeaway without being subject to sexual advances by the responsible people working there.""

The police officer said that the takeaway's owner, Soliman Salalm, and his business partner were ""either oblivious to the fact that (the suspect) worked at Tasty or deliberately concealing it.

""Either is worrying and not in line with what is expected of the licence holder"".

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce9gv7k2ym1o,"More than 1,200 textile workers illegally underpaid",2024,"HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) identified National Minimum Wage arrears for 1,268 garment workers in Leicester

More than 1,200 garment workers in Leicester were illegally underpaid over the last five years, figures obtained by the BBC have revealed.

The significant wage exploitation has been found in figures released by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), covering the past five financial years from 2019-20 to 2023-24.

A total of Â£177,678 in National Minimum Wage arrears for workers were identified, with penalties of Â£338,504 issued to textile companies in the same time period.

The BBC's freedom of information (FOI) request also revealed that none of the employers responsible for the underpayments had received criminal convictions.

The figures come after damning headlines about Leicester's garment supply chain during the pandemic.

Earlier this year, several workers from Indiatold the BBC they accepted between Â£3 and Â£5 an hourbecause they struggled to find work and could not speak English.

Sewing machine operator Paramjit Kaur said some employers covered their tracks by creating a paper trail, which appeared to show she earned the National Living Wage.

""They would show 'full pay' on the payslip but once the money was in my bank, I was told to return it,"" she said.

""I used to give it back in cash. Three or four factories used to do this.""

When asked why she returned the money, the 61-year-old said: ""It felt dirty and bad but I needed to work. No-one was paying more.""

Paramjit Kaur says she accepted as little as Â£3 an hour

Ms Kaur was supported by the Fashion-workers Advice Bureau Leicester (FAB-L), which has been backed and funded by several retail brands.

FAB-L said it had helped about 90 workers recover unpaid wages informally, by persuading garment businesses to pay to avoid complaints to the brands they supplied.

But the BBC's FOI has revealed details of formal investigations into minimum wage compliance in the textile industry.

HMRC said it had opened 171 cases in Leicester - between April 2019 and April 2024 - which formed the bulk of 255 cases across the UK textile industry.

The tax authority added it had identified more than Â£390,000 in wage arrears for more than 2,000 workers nationally.

The campaign group Labour Behind the Label described the new figures as ""significant"" and ""deeply concerning"", but not surprising.

Kaenat Issufo, from the group, said the underpayment of Leicester textile workers showed there were continuing systemic challenges.

Ms Issufo called for more sustainable, ethical practices that prioritise workers' rights.

""I hope this encourages further action from both policymakers and industry leaders to make Leicester's garment sector a model of integrity and fairness,"" she said.

Most of the HMRC investigations began between 2020 and 2022

HMRC said it had already recovered more than 60% of the unpaid wages it identified nationally, and was using civil powers to recover outstanding pay.

That includes taking action to stop employers liquidating their businesses to avoid paying workers.

When asked what happens if a company responsible for wage arrears goes bust, a HMRC spokesperson said: ""HMRC will engage with the official receiver and register the debt, making sure that any workers owed money are recognised as creditors.

""Where HMRC has evidence that directors of limited companies have broken NMW [National Minimum Wage] law and/or acted inappropriately to avoid their obligations, we may make referrals to the Insolvency Service and seek director disqualifications.""

Most of the HMRC investigations began between April 2020 and April 2022.

Its FOI response confirmed there had been no convictions related to wage arrears, with HMRC adding prosecutions were reserved for the most serious cases of non-compliance, because it can cause delays and does not guarantee workers will be paid.

Meanwhile, the government has announced plans to set up a Fair Work Agency as part of itsEmployment Rights Bill,external.

At a solicitor's office in Huddersfield, Zohaib Hussain said he could ""make documents"" including ""business agreements"" for a fee of Â£3,500 to help dodge immigration fines.

His employer, RKS Solicitors, confirmed he had been ""permanently dismissed"" a day after the investigation was broadcast and a ""police report"" had been made.

Mr Hussain previously said he categorically denied ""all allegations, insinuations, and claims"".

They exposed how a Kurdish crime network isenabling migrants to work illegally in mini-marts across the UK.

Our investigation also uncovered a man at the centre of an immigration crime group who said he had""customers in every city""and could enable illegal working.

Following the reports, senior politicians warned that the crime networks wereacting as a pull factor for illegal migration to the UK.

Questioned by the BBC on whether the government has lost control of High Streets to Kurdish organised crime gangs, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: ""What your reporters were able to scrutinise and show is absolutely evidence of why our system is broken.

""It's why this government has been cracking down on illegal working.""

In one of the investigations, an undercover reporter posed as a mini mart owner who had received a fine from immigration enforcement worth up to Â£60,000 for employing illegal workers, and met with Zohaib Hussain.

During the meeting at a solicitor's in Huddersfield, Mr Hussain fired questions at our reporter about his cover story.

""How many illegal workers? So how much is the fine? How many times did they catch you?""

Then, with a chuckle, he asked what was sold in the mini-mart: ""Do you sell vapes? Legal or illegal? Bit of both as well?""

Mr Hussain went on to explain how to avoid the fine.  He said: ""Sometimes we might have to make documents,"" said Mr Hussain, such as ""business agreements"".

Our undercover reporter then asked if the fine would be transferred to someone else's name. Mr Hussain said that would be ""the last resort.""

Before the meeting ended, Mr Hussain warned that the immigration authorities would want to jump on the fine straight away - making a cutting-motion across his throat.

He said his charges would be Â£3,500 and he ""would look after us"".

During the whole meeting with Mr Hussain, a man known as Shaxawan was present in the room.

Shaxawan was revealed by the BBC as a man at the centre of an organised crime network involved in the facilitation of illegal working.

He told undercover journalists that he and his associates could help migrants - including asylum seekers - to set up businesses illegally and ""confuse"" immigration enforcement.

In Companies House listings, Shaxawan is named as Kardos Mateen, a British resident in his 30s, and has been the director of 18 businesses across the north of England, including many High Street mini marts.

The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) said the waste at Netherplace Dye Works was being sprayed in a bid to control flies on the site.

Sepa's Kenny Boag explained that with the start of spraying he hoped removal of the waste could start soon.

Local residents have complained about the growing number of flies.

The infestation was also reported to be causing problems in neighbouring Clarkston and Giffnock.

The waste is being treated as a criminal investigation, but Sepa said remedial measures could be taken in tandem with evidence gathering.

Mr Boag, Sepa's head of operations for the south west, said he recognised that ""time is of the essence"".

In a statement on Tuesday, he said: ""Sepa's primary role in matters at this time is to ensure that the waste that has been illegally deposited can be safely and responsibly managed, transported and disposed of at suitably licensed facilities.

""Importantly also in this case we had to give consideration to the treatment of this waste, to address the fly problem which has been plaguing local residents.

""Over the last few days we've been working closely with the landowner and his waste contractor and pest control contractors, and we are pleased to confirm that the pest control contractor is on site as we speak treating the waste. We are also close to agreeing a method statement with the waste contractor, and hope to see removals being removed from the site to authorised disposal facilities soon.

""Sepa will continue to maintain a presence on the site both to support the ongoing works and also importantly to gather evidence so we may identify the persons responsible for this criminal act.""

Waste can be seen spilling from doorways of the building

Mr Boag earlier said loose and baled cardboard, construction and demolition waste, as well as municipal wastes and liquid wastes had been found at the site.

He added: ""Given the array of waste materials that can be seen at this stage... it is vital that the correct method of management, removal, transport and disposal is taken to ensure that it does not result in harmful or illegal consequences elsewhere.

""Sepa have had daily interaction with the landowner to help them understand the scale of the problem and also assist them in resolving a number of immediate issues which could affect the local environment.

""An essential role for Sepa going forward is to identify the persons responsible for this act and we have designed our investigation to run alongside any removal works, so that we do not impeded the rate at which this site is cleared.""",Scotland,Scotland Politics

Amazon delivery drivers regularly work ""illegal"" hours and receive less than the minimum wage, it has been claimed.

Drivers for agencies contracted by the internet giant told an undercover reporter they were expected to deliver up to 200 parcels a day.

Some admitted breaking speed limits to stay on schedule, while others said time was not allowed for toilet breaks.

Amazon said it was committed to ensuring drivers drive safely and legally, and are ""fairly compensated"".

The retailer could face questions in parliament over the working conditions at the company.

A BBC reporter got a job with AHC services, one of many agencies which supplies drivers to the firm's delivery wing Amazon Logistics in the south of England, and which the BBC had heard a lot of complaints about.

During a two-week stint with AHC at Amazon's Avonmouth depot in Bristol, he said he:

Received a fixed rate of Â£110 per route, or set of deliveries, completed each day

Worked more than 11 hours a day - delivery drivers are breaking the law if they exceed this limit

Was told by an agency supervisor he ""didn't have to worry about a seatbelt"" because ""the police won't stop"" a delivery driver

Had colleagues tell him they had to ""defecate in bags"" and ""urinate in bottles"" because there was no time for toilet breaks

Was paid Â£93.47 for three days' work in his first week, after deductions including optional van hire for a week and insurance - equal to Â£2.59 per hour

Received the equivalent of Â£4.76 per hour in his second week when he worked four days

Several drivers told him they were paid the equivalent of an hourly rate below the national minimum wage of Â£7.20, mainly due to working long hours to deliver all the parcels they were assigned.

Some agency staff complained the system does not allow for traffic jams and does not factor in time for breaks, he said.

Former driver, Charlie Chikaviro, said the pressure to deliver parcels left him with no choice but to drive quickly.

""I had to, the way it was designed. You're going to have to do that,"" he said.

""I had a few crashes... but not bad crashes.""

Former supervisor for AHC Cody Cooper said she ordered one driver to stop driving because he fell asleep at the wheel

Cody Cooper, a former supervisor who left AHC services a year ago, said she ordered one driver, who fell asleep at the wheel, to stop driving because she feared he could ""end up killing someone"".

""It was coming up to school time and there could [have been] a group of schoolchildren walking along... and he could have steered off,"" she said.

Amazon Logistics requires agency drivers to be self-employed, and therefore not entitled to the minimum wage or employment rights like sick pay or holiday pay.

The undercover reporter was paid the equivalent of Â£2.60 per hour for one week's work

Tonia Novitz, professor of labour law at Bristol University, said in her opinion drivers contracted by AHC should not be classed as self-employed, because they do not determine their own routes, days of work or rest periods.

""From the evidence I've seen, which suggests [the undercover reporter] would be regarded as a worker or agency worker, he should be getting the national minimum wage,"" she said.

In a statement Amazon said: ""As independent contractors of our delivery providers, drivers deliver at their own pace, take breaks at their discretion, and are able to choose the suggestion route or develop their own.""

The company said it expected drivers to be paid a minimum of Â£12 per hour ""before bonuses, incentives and fuel reimbursements"", and it required independent delivery providers to ensure drivers were fully licensed and insured and obeyed ""all applicable traffic and safety laws"".

In the past six months, drivers drove a daily average of 8.5 hours and were on duty for 9.1 hours, it added.

Oxford-based AHC dismissed claims put to them by the BBC as ""historic and based on isolated examples which occurred over a year ago"" and said: ""Since then we have made changes to the way our checks are carried out and taken a number of steps to improve our ways of working.""

The firm said it took road safety and the welfare of its contracted drivers ""extremely seriously"", and that drivers were free to choose when they worked.

Iain Wright, the Labour MP and chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy select committee, told the BBC: ""These are serious allegations that call into question a lot of business practises carried out by Amazon.

""There are rising challenges in respect of what's happening with online retail and ever growing customer demand.

""It's a balance  - it's making sure that the customer gets what he or she wants, at a time that is suitable for them. But it shouldn't be done on the back of exploitation of workers.""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-63431335,Keeping tips from workers could be illegal under new law,2022,"Employers could be forced to pay their employees tips in their entirety under a proposed law

Employers not paying workers their tips in their entirety, without deductions, may soon become illegal.

A bill sponsored by the Conservative MP for Ynys MÃ´n, Virginia Crosbie, would also introduce an obligation to allocate tips fairly among workers.

The UK government is backing the move and said it would benefit more than two million workers.

The trade union Unite said it would reserve judgement until ""potential loopholes"" in the bill were closed.

Kristian Cuffin, 30, who owns the Cuffed In Coffee cafe in Holyhead, in Ms Crosbie's constituency, said he could not imagine not already giving his staff the entirety of their tips.

How does the world tip? In some places, itâs offensive!

Should you tip the takeaway delivery driver?

""That's what they're intended for,"" he said.

Kristian Cuffin said all staff work equal hours and so tips at Cuffed In Coffee are divided equally.

All tips at Mr Cuffin's cafe are split evenly among staff each week, with electronic tips logged in a report at the end of each day.

""For us, I can imagine it's a lot easier because we all work fairly even hours. If somebody is working 40 hours and someone's only working five, then to distribute it evenly might not work.

""I suppose it depends on your business. But for us, it's quite a simple process,"" he added.

Ms Crosbie took over responsibility for the bill when Dean Russell, the backbench MP who introduced it, became a minister.

She acknowledged that most employers were already ""doing the right thing,"" but said the bill would help ""create a level playing field"".

Under the law, employees would also be given the right to view their employer's tipping record.

""It means that when somebody is in a restaurant or they're in a beauty bar or a taxi, and they pay a tip on their credit card, that this tip will go to the person that actually served them or helped them,"" she said.

Virginia Crosbie says the bill will help ""create a level playing field""

Currently, businesses who receive tips by card have the choice of whether to keep it or pass it on to workers. Cash tips, on the other hand, are legally the property of staff.

In 2021 the UK government said 80% of all tipping now happened by card and suggested this had made it easier for businesses to keep the funds.

Many of the jobs in the MP's constituency are in hospitality and tourism and she has been holding listening events with business owners and workers to help draw up a tipping code of conduct.

Rhys Taylor-Roberts, 20, who is one of six employees at Cuffed by Coffee, said he ""100%"" thinks the bill would be good news.

""It increases your wage, it gives you more motivation to have better customer service, it's appreciation that's being shown for your craft,"" he said.

Rhys Taylor-Roberts said tips act as a ""top-up, a little help""

""A few pounds does make a difference, it pays for the little things so that you can save for the big things. Whether it's dinner or you're going to get a new haircut. It's like a top-up, a little help,"" he added.

Unite has previously said it was ""not confident"" the measures would address poor practices.

Its hospitality spokesman Dave Turnbull said it has now secured a commitment that ""potential loopholes"" would be closed.

He added that the union would reserve its judgement until these changes ""see the light of day"".

The UK government first announced plans to ensure all tips go to workers in 2018, but these were never passed into law.

A UK government official said: ""The Employment (Allocation of Tips) Bill, backed by the government, will ensure that all tips go to staff by making it unlawful to hold back service charges from employees.""

Two men who employed illegal workers on their mobile phone accessory stalls have been given suspended sentences.

Shakir Ullah, 35, is a director of Digital Circle Ltd, and Irfan Ali, 32, runs a company called Simply Peach.

In the first such case in Northern Ireland, they both pleaded guilty to five charges of facilitating unlawful entry to the UK.

The charges stemmed from Home Office raids on their stalls in 19 shopping centres in Northern Ireland.

Eleven illegal workers were discovered during the raids almost two years ago.

They were subsequently removed to the countries they had come from; in this case, Pakistan or India, while a prosecution was begun against their employers.

Both men, who are originally from Pakistan, run a number of businesses based in Manchester.

Carolyne Lindsay, of Immigration Enforcement's crime team, said: ""This case reinforces the message about our commitment to tackling those responsible for bringing illegal immigrants to the UK.

""Not only did Ullah and Ali knowingly try to flout immigration laws, they also preyed on vulnerable people desperate to reach the UK.""

That was a message echoed by the prosecution after the two men pleaded guilty.

A defence lawyer, however, said the pair did not accept that they had exploited any of the workers.

He said they had all applied for the jobs and been paid fairly, and there was no suggestion of people trafficking.

The judge accepted that this was the case and both men were spared jail, with suspended sentences of 18 months for Ali and three years for Ullah.

Assets have also been seized from the men's companies under the Proceeds of Crime Act.

This includes some Â£140,000 which is currently frozen.

A Chinese restaurant previously fined Â£135,000 for employing three illegal workers has now been banned from selling alcohol.

The White Horse in Longford, near Gloucester, was visited by Home Office inspectors in August last year. They found three workers from Indonesia who had no right to work in the UK.

The Home Office handed the Â£135,000 civil penalty to the owner's company R&R (Gloucester) and called for the restaurant's council-issued licence to be revoked.

Ahead of a licence review hearing on Thursday held by Tewkesbury Borough Council, owner Lee Yap Kheang said the business would ""without doubt"" have to close if it could not sell alcohol.

The White Horse was found to be employing three illegal workers from Indonesia

Mr Kheang told councillors the restaurant now employed five workers from the local community, adding: ""We cannot survive without the profit revenue from alcohol sales as the economic climate for restaurants is so tough now.""

He said he had worked very hard to build a village restaurant against all odds â including repeated floods.

""People rely upon me and the village is my home and its residents, my deeply valued friends,"" he said.

According to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service, the council's licensing sub-committee nevertheless voted to revoke the restaurant's licence.

""We hope this decision makes it clear that serious breaches won't be ignored,"" a council spokesperson said.

Home Office inspectors had initially visited the restaurant after being told in a tip-off that Mr Kheang had been employing illegal workers for no pay, in return for food and accommodation at the restaurant.

He told the inspector the workers helped out only occasionally with minor tasks such as washing dishes and tidying the garden.

""When questioned about right to work checks, Kheang admitted to seeing the letters about claiming asylum but did not conduct any checks,"" a Home Office report stated.

""He further admits, 'I know they are not allowed to work.'""

Mr Kheang now has a right to appeal regarding the restaurant's licence.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1lv153ydm6o,Illegal workers held in raids on nail bars and takeaways,2025,"Raids took place across the country - including at a car wash in south London

Hundreds of migrants were arrested in January as part of a UK-wide crackdown on illegal working, the government has said.

Enforcement teams raided 828 premises including nail bars, car washes, and restaurants and made 609 arrests - a 73% increase on the previous January.

Home Office Minister Dame Angela Eagle told the BBC the decision to release footage of the arrests was to send a message about the realities of working illegally and she defended the government's approach as ""compassionate"".

Later on Monday, MPs will debate the government's immigration bill. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp has called it a ""weak bill that won't stop the boats"".

Vape shops in Cheshire and a grocery warehouse in south London were among the places raided.

Those arrested made the journey to the UK through a mix of routes, including by crossing the Channel and by overstaying legitimately-granted visas.

Despite having won a landslide election victory seven months ago, senior Labour strategists are already increasingly worried about losing voters concerned about immigration to Reform come the next election.

Chris Mason's analysis: Ministers want to show toughness on immigration

Party figures believe that merely describing the arrests and deportations is not enough â hence the decision to release footage today of them taking place, allowing people to see with their own eyes.

But there are others in the Labour Party who fear that focusing on illegal immigration only increases the salience of an issue where they could never and would never want to adopt as hardline an approach as Reform.

Some Labour MPs, particularly on the left of the party, believe the government should do more to establish safe and legal routes for people to come to the UK and talk about the benefits of immigration.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Dame Angela was asked if releasing footage of the raids aligned with Sir Keir Starmer's previous pledge to create an immigration system ""based on compassion and dignity"".

""I don't believe for one minute that enforcing the law and ensuring that people who break the law face the consequences of doing that, up to and including deportation, arrest, is not compassionate,"" she said.

She added that it is ""important that we show what we are doing and it's important that we send messages to people who may have been sold lies about what will await them in the UK if they get themselves smuggled in"".

The government also intends to reduce the number of hotels housing asylum seekers, Dame Angela said.

Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Monday, she said there were plans to close nine of the 218 hotels currently in use by the end of March.

From the start of the Labour government in July up to 31 January, 3,930 arrests were made over 5,424 visits by immigration enforcement officers, the Home Office said.

A total of 1,090 civil penalty notices were also issued, with employers facing a fine of up to Â£60,000 per worker if found liable.

During the same period, four of the ""biggest return flights in the UK's history"" were also carried out, the Home Office said, returning more than 800 people.

But Reform UK leader Nigel Farage described the new figures released by the government as feeble, compared with the numbers that had entered the country.

Across the 31 days of January, there were 1,098 people who arrived in the UK illegally on small boats.

The government said it launched a social media campaign in Vietnam in December and Albania in January discouraging people from making the journey to the UK.

The adverts highlight stories from migrants who entered the UK illegally ""only to face debt, exploitation and a life far from what they were promised"", the Home Office said.

Dame Angela said this campaign was introduced to counter ""quite sophisticated ads"" placed online by people smugglers, which ""tell lies about the situation in Britain, about how easy it is to get jobs"".

People who come to the UK illegally are ""more likely to be living in squalid conditions, being exploited by vicious gangs"", she said.

Later, the government's Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill will be debated in the House of Commons in its second reading.

The bill aims to introduce a raft of new offences and counter terrorism-style powers to clamp down on people smugglers bringing migrants across the Channel.

But Labour ministers have not provided a specific target on when a drop in small boat crossings could be expected.

The Conservatives said they had put forward an amendment to the immigration bill in a bid to include their own immigration proposals: to double how long it takes migrants to get indefinite leave to remain and, after that, require them to wait five years rather than one before they can apply for citizenship.

Philp added that ""an effective removals deterrent is needed"" to stop small boat crossings, something he said Labour had scrapped, a reference to the former government's plan to send illegal migrants to Rwanda.

He gave vague answers when asked who had hired him.

The permission for Chicken N Beer in Stanfield Road, Bournemouth, to sell alcoholwas removed in Mayafter immigration officials saw a man and a woman run out of it in February.

A new company has applied to sell alcohol there but Dorset Police said it has ""significant concerns"" about the relationship between its owner and the man previously responsible for the bar.

Cloud Brands Ltd's application for the new premises licence at Chicken N Beer will be decided by Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council's licensing sub-committee on Tuesday.

The company said it would ""operate in strict adherence to licensing restrictions"" if the application is approved.

But Dorset Police's licensing officer Louise Busfield said it is ""essential"" the force gets ""robust assurances"" about the relationship between the potential operator and the former company that ran it.

""Dorset Police has significant concerns that this application may amount to an attempt to continue operating the premises under a new entity, while still maintaining influence or control by the former operator whose licence was revoked,"" she added.

Neither of the people apprehended after fleeing Chicken N Beer earlier this year had ever got permission to work in the country, the Home Office said in May.

The bar's former premises licence holder, Roy Francis, said he had resigned as a director of the company that previously ran it before the man and woman were found working there.

Under the Licensing Act 2003, which is mostly managed by councils, licence holders must abide by its conditions including the prevention of crime and disorder.

A pizzeria owner from Cumbria who hired two illegal workers has been banned from being a company director for six years.

Dondu Ozmicco, 35,  employed the workers at Flames Pizzeria in Ulverston, without doing right-to-work checks.

Immigration Enforcement fined the business Â£20,000 after they raided the premises in 2020.

The business went into liquidation in March 2022.

Kevin Read, chief investigator at the Insolvency Service, said: âDonduâ¯Ozmiccoâsâ¯failureâ¯toâ¯ensureâ¯theâ¯requiredâ¯right-to-work checks were carried out led to the employment of two illegal workers, in contravention of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

âThis represents a serious breach of legislation and of the standards expected of company directors.""

Ms Ozmicco, of Scale Hall Lane, Lancaster, was the sole director of Flames Pizzeria â NM Catering Ltd, from its formation in December 2019 until it entered liquidation in March 2022.

The pizzeria was visited by officers from Immigration Enforcement in October 2020 and the company was found to be employing two illegal workers.

Aâ¯civilâ¯penaltyâ¯ofâ¯Â£20,000â¯wasâ¯issuedâ¯by Immigration Enforcement in March 2021 which remained unpaid at liquidation.

One of the workers said he had worked at the premises for between one and two weeks.

HM Inspector Kendal Barnett, Home Office Immigration Enforcement said: âIllegal working cheats honest workers out of employment, puts vulnerable people at risk, and defrauds the public purse.

âWe will continue to work with partners including the Insolvency Service, as well as law enforcement agencies to tackle illegal migration in all its forms.â

The Secretary of State for Business and Trade accepted a disqualification undertaking from Ms Ozmicco, and her six-year ban began on 10 January.

It prevents her from becoming involved in the promotion, formation or management of a company, without the permission of the court.",England,Cumbria

No-one from the firm - which also has branches in Stamford Bridge, Dublin and Dubai - was available to comment.

The UK Border Agency said it had raided the restaurants after receiving a tip off.

Immigration officials arrested two Ecuadorians and one Albanian during the raid at the Knightsbridge branch in Yeoman's Row in November.

Three Brazilians and one Algerian were arrested in the second raid at Frankie's Braganza in Chiswick High Road.

If it is proven that they were working illegally they face deportation.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdjgrgn7yy9o,Restaurant that had illegal workers keeps licence,2024,"Home Office officials raided the restaurant in September, Dorset Police said

A restaurant that employed illegal workers will keep its licence but will need to adhere to new conditions.

Weymouth Tandoori in Maiden Street, Dorset, was raided by Home Office officials on 24 September, who said they received information that immigration offences ""were routinely being committed"" there.

After Dorset councillors reviewed the restaurant's premises licence, they said written records must be kept to show employees can legally work in the UK.

They concluded the restaurant's licence holder, Jamal Uddin, had not operated in a ""deliberate"" way to ""defraud or to exploit workers"".

Dorset Police asked for Weymouth Tandoori'spremises licence,external, which allows the sale of alcohol, to be reviewed.

Tim Munro, for Mr Uddin, said his client ""demonstrated poor administration processes rather than a deliberate attempt to flout the law"".

He said Mr Uddin had expected a firm to carry out the right-to-work checks on employees but later found out that these had not been done.

Mr Uddin then carried out some checks on one member of staff but they were ""inadequate and led to the employment of a worker who didn't have the necessary right to work in the UK in that sector"", Mr Munro added.

But Dorset Council's licensing sub-committee said revoking the restaurant's licence ""would not necessarily resolve the issues because the restaurant could continue without the sale of alcohol"".

It found it was ""clear"" that Mr Uddin was getting help ""to ensure that the business operates in a lawful way"" in the future.

Mr Uddin must ensure that right-to-work checks are carried out and that evidence of those can be inspected by a licensing officer.

Dorset Police said a report by immigration officials about the restaurant ""contains sensitive information and cannot be in the public domain"".
