https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-63184790,Turkish and Kurdish workers face exploitation in London says report,2022,"taner olmez (right) is kurdish and says he has often had to work for low pay with no annual leave

turkish and kurdish workers are being exploited due to a lack of knowledge about workers' rights, according to a report.

the refugee and workers cultural association (rwca), which wrote the report, said hundreds of workers reported low wages and no holiday or sick pay.

one worker described it as a ""vicious circle"" due to limited work options.

the rwca said information on rights should be available in more languages.

taner olmez is kurdish and has had several jobs since arriving in the uk three years ago.

in one, he worked six days a week, 12 hours a day for just â£320 a week.

he said: ""there was no reference to a holiday pay - if i didn't turn up i didn't get paid"".

he knows of many others in london who have been in the same position.

of the hundreds of turkish and kurdish migrant workers interviewed in the city, many also reported long hours without excess pay, and facing bullying and harassment in the work place.

one worker spoken to in compiling the report told researchers: ""we live in a vicious circle in the service sector. i am on annual leave, but i am not paid. i said that my child was born, i couldn't even take a day off from work to go to him.""

one third of the workers interviewed were working illegally and the rwca said this led to ""additional victimisation and exploitation"" by employers who abuse the situation.

ibrahim avcil says some of the conditions sounded like a third world country and not the uk

ibrahim avcil of the rwca said: ""we were extremely shocked to find out that the conditions these turkish and kurdish employees work under are extreme. you would think you would not see [them] in the uk but a third world country.""

the report made a number of recommendations, which included a called for enforcement of employment rights, better education for employers and employees, and resources in other languages for all ethnicities living in london.

it also recommended protection for workers who report breaches.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-65313936,London Overground: Design work for West London Orbital route begins,2023,"tfl hopes the west london orbital service could start running in the early 2030s

plans for a new london overground link in west london are progressing, london's mayor sadiq khan has said.

engineering consultants who worked on the elizabeth line have been chosen for thewest london orbital service,external.

""this engineering design will help determine the cost of delivering the scheme, which is currently unfunded,"" transport for london (tfl) said.

it hopes the scheme, which would connect hounslow with hendon and west hampstead, could start next decade.

elizabeth line: what rail services will come next?

the design work is being funded by the west london alliance, a partnership between the boroughs of barnet, brent, ealing, hammersmith and fulham, harrow, hillingdon and hounslow.

it will be carried out by international engineering consultancy mott macdonald, tfl told bbc london.

the company previously advised on the elizabeth line's route, structures and rail systems.

a proposed route for the west london orbital service

last month the mayor of london was asked to provide an update on the project's progress by elly baker, labour assembly member (am) at city hall.

in a written answer, he said the modelling and consulting work would ""lead to an updated business case for the scheme and confirmation of the stations to be served"".

he added that a network rail timetable assessment found the ""west london orbital service is expected to be achievable"".

old oak common is expected to become a new super-hub station

if it goes ahead the route would span approximately 11.5 miles (18.5km) across four boroughs and make use of track currently used by freight services in west london, tfl proposals state.

four new stations would be built along the route, while old oak common is expected to become a new super-hub station, connecting the overground to high speed two (hs2) services and the elizabeth line.

the plans are not yet approved and a public consultation about the route will be held in the future.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-13886174,Job cuts deal halts strike by postal workers in London,2011,"the union said up to 3,500 royal mail staff would strike unless reassurances were given over jobs

strike action by postal workers in london has been averted after a union reached a deal with the royal mail in a dispute over job cuts.

the communication workers union (cwu) voted for industrial action on 24 may after royal mail announced plans to close mail centres in the capital.

on thursday, the cwu said it had received guarantees of no compulsory redundancies while proposed changes were rolled out.

workers who were balloted were based at mount pleasant, nine elms at vauxhall, east london mail centre at bow and rathbone place in central london.

they voted to strike by four-to-one in a turnout of 54% after fears centre closures would mean compulsory redundancies.

the union said up to 3,500 royal mail staff would strike unless reassurances were given over job security.

royal mail said the decision to close east and south london mail centres was made after a nine-month consultation with the trade unions.

dave ward, the union's deputy general secretary, described the two-week negotiations as difficult but said staff in london now had ""real choice over their futures"".

""it will mean two out of the seven mail centres within greater london closing in the summer of 2012, but crucially this will now be done in a way that puts people first,"" said mr ward.

""it's an important approach that will bring necessary operational change which looks after staff and customers as well as the company.""

royal mail's regional operations director for london, gerry o'rourke, said: ""we welcome this development.

""we had already made substantial progress on the essential changes to our mail processing operations in london.

""the union's support for our plans means that both royal mail and the cwu can concentrate on working closely with everyone affected to ensure that colleagues get the very best support and advice through what we know is a difficult and sensitive period.""

as a result of the changes 580 people are likely to leave on redundancy terms. more than 670 full-time staff have expressed an interest in taking voluntary redundancy packages.",security,not mentioned
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4nw2r72l5ro,Illegal levels of air toxins found in many boroughs,2023,"levels of the toxin nitrogen dioxide (no2) in the air at five or more locations in 14 london boroughs were found to exceed the uk legal limit of 40 âµg/m3 during tests

in total, sites in 31 boroughs had levels of the pollutant that exceeded the recommended limit set by the world health organisation

the single highest concentration of no2 was found at harlesden high street

the mayor of london believes the study results make the case for the controversial expansion of the ultra low emission zone

levels of the toxin nitrogen dioxide (no2) in the air across 14 london boroughs were found to exceed the uk legal limits, according to a new study from city hall.

the single highest level - of almost three times the legal limit - was found in brent, on harlesden high street.

air quality tests carried out across london also found levels of the toxin broke a recommended limit set by the world health organisation (who).

london mayor sadiq khan said the data was ""shocking proof"" that air quality was a problem ""in every single part of the capital"".

the mayor of london says the results prove the case for expanding the ultra low emission zone to cover the whole of greater london

the study,externalincluded results of testing carried out at 1,823 locations across 31 london boroughs throughout 2021.

london's councils are required to monitor air pollutants in their boroughs each year.

the data could not be compared with previous years as this was the first time an entire dataset hds been compiled and analysed, city hall said.

the who's recommended limit of nitrogen dioxide (10 âµg/m3) was exceeded at all 1, 823 locations tested across 31 boroughs

a uk legal limit (40 âµg/m3) was exceeded in five or more locations in 14 boroughs: brent, the city of london, croydon, ealing, greenwich, hammersmith & fulham, hackney, havering, kensington & chelsea, lambeth, merton, richmond, southwark and wandsworth

in total, illegal levels of no2 were found at one of more sites in 26 boroughs

the locations with the highest concentration of nitrogen dioxide were harlesden high street, romford town centre and wembley high road

however, the number of sites tested within each borough varied significantly - 131 were measured in newham, while just 15 were tested in barnet.

two boroughs, bexley and harrow, did not contribute to the study. bexley council said the results would not have been representative due to the covid-19 pandemic and the cost of testing would have of ""very limited use and a poor use of the public purse"".

it says it will undertake the tests in 2024 and that it works towards uk laws rather than who guidelines.

according to city hall, the results show similar average pollution concentration in inner and outer london, supporting the case to expand the ultra low emission zone (ulez).

the scheme, which charges drivers of the most polluting cars â£12.50 a day to enter, is to be extended from august to cover the whole of greater london.

âthis data is yet more shocking proof that londonâs air quality has been in serious breach of the recognised global standard - and itâs a problem in every single part of the capital,"" mr khan said.

âthis is why i made the difficult decision to expand the ulez london-wide - to help save lives and to give all londoners the right to breathe cleaner air.â

five conservative councils in and around london are to take legal action later this year, in an attempt to stop the expansion.

among them is bexley council, which did not carry out the tests for no2 emissions for this study.

tony devenish am, city hall conservatives environment spokesperson, said the expansion would have a ""negligible"" effect on air quality and a ""devastating impact on low-income families, businesses and charities"".

by tom edwards, bbc london transport & environment correspondent

one of the arguments used by those against ulez expansion is that it isnât needed as air pollution isnât that bad in outer london.

well this latest data published by the mayor is another attempt to prove that it is - in what is becoming an increasingly febrile and political information war.

this data is actually collated and reported by the london boroughs themselves (although 2 didnât participate) and it confirms what health experts have said for a long time - that who limits are breached everywhere in the capital.

and while who limits are lower than the ukâs legal limits, itâs important to remember health experts say there is no proven safe level of pollution.

and while this probably wonât change the minds of those who think ulez expansion isnât needed, it could give more ammunition to those who argue that urban environments are no place for older, more polluting vehicles.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2vepjx4plo,New works will mark 25 years of Tube art project,2025,"three women, a mural at brixton tube station by claudette johnson, was created in 2024

transport for london (tfl) says it hopes to ""encourage meaningful conversations between artists and the public"" with four new artworks that will be displayed across the tube network in 2025.

the pieces are part of the art on the underground programme, which marks its 25th anniversary this year.

a work by ahmet ãäã¼t will be unveiled at stratford station in march, and a new pocket tube map featuring a design by agnes denes, based on her work map projections, will be released in the spring.

in june a new audio commission by rory pilgrim will be heard by millions of commuters at waterloo station, and in november a new painting by rudy loewe will become the ninth mural instalment at brixton station.

eleanor pinfield, head of art on the underground, said the commissions were meant to ""foreground interactions"" with art in daily life.

she said: ""across 2025, the programme will interrogate how art can save us and what it means to gather together, in shared space and with local communities.

""seen and heard by millions, the 2025 programme is a response to london today, whilst always reflecting on our past and possible futures.""

existing works in the programme include alexandre da cunha's kinetic sculpture at battersea power station station and mark wallinger's labyrinth across the london underground network.

the first 2025 artwork - to be unveiled on 18 march at stratford station - is a large-scale piece by artist ahmet ãäã¼t called saved by the whale's tail, saved by art.

among the artists in the 2025 programme is rory pilgrim, who created this artwork entitled pink and green visit the prison

mr ãäã¼t's new work was inspired by an incident in 2020 when a train on the rotterdam metro overran the stop blocks at a station on an elevated metro line.

a carriage, at risk of falling into the water beneath, was ""saved"" by a 10m-high public art sculpture of a whale's tail, which prevented its fall.

tfl said: ""this visual metaphor for the power of art to save lives provided the impetus for a project that seeks to uncover many more stories.

""encompassing a major installation alongside a call out to the public for stories that champion, interrogate and celebrate how art has saved lives, the commission culminates in a prize for the most moving submission, for which ãäã¼t has created a sculpture akin to an award ceremony trophy to be awarded later in 2025.""

works that debuted as part of art on the underground in 2024 included:

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj97rv0e0x9o,Airbnb to accommodate domestic abuse survivors,2025,"in london there were more than 90,000 recorded cases of domestic abuse in the year to august

charity women's aid will work with a leading online short-term let provider and city hall to give emergency accommodation to some of london's domestic abuse survivors.

a pilot scheme will provide up to 60 survivors and their children with free emergency accommodation in airbnb-listed properties across london for up to two weeks.

survivors will also get one-to-one support such as legal advice, advocacy and translation, and help with practicalities like transport.

farah nazeer, chief executive of women's aid, said the pilot ""will be a valuable opportunity for us to see the impact that these collaborations can have"".

ms nazeer added: ""systemic underfunding of specialist services has sadly meant that victims and survivors seeking support have been turned away at a point of crisis, with refuges operating a 60% refusal rate.

""collaborations such as these will mean survivors now have options, instead of facing imminent homelessness or being forced to return to the abuser.""

in london there were more than 90,000 cases of domestic abuse recorded by the police in the year to august 2025.

mayor of london sir sadiq khan said he was supporting the new pilot with up to â£50,000, matched by a â£50,000 commitment from airbnb and a further â£10,000 fromâ¯women's aid in addition to the use of their london refuges.

staff from women's aid will use the airbnb platform to book the accommodation on behalf of the survivors, and safeguarding checks have been taken ahead of approving each listed property being offered as part of the pilot.

city hall said the pilot would run until the end of the year and if successful it may open the door to additional future partnership projects to support survivors of domestic abuse.

sir sadiq said: ""i am committed to continuing to work with partners to explore innovations to ensure survivors can access the care and support they need, whilst also working with the met to go after perpetrators of these heinous crimes.""

the mayor said he had previously allocated â£54m to the domestic abuse safe accommodation programme, which has helped more than 40,000 survivors of domestic abuse since it launched in 2021.

two illegal street parties have been broken up by police during another night of unlawful gatherings in london.

dispersal zones were put in place in clapham common and tooting bec common to clear crowds causing ""significant disruptions"" on saturday night.

the zones allow uniformed officers extra powers to order people to leave the area and not return.

she said the rise of mass gatherings held in recent days was ""unacceptable"" and that it risked a second wave of covid-19 which would devastate the uk economy.

ms patel said ""thuggishness and violent behaviour is simply unacceptable"", and more resources would be made available to the police if needed.

she also encouraged people to follow rules and guidance when pubs and restaurants begin to reopen next weekend.

many local residents complained on twitter about the rubbish left behind.

pictures showed bins overflowing, as well as plastic bags, bottles and other waste strewn across the common. the rubbish has now been cleared.

lambeth council, which looks after clapham common, said it had put more bins out and in may, it had taken away an extra 22 tonnes of waste compared to the same time last year.

shirley kermer, chair of friends of clapham common, said: ""when people arrived on the common first thing this morning, there was disbelief, dismay, there were tears and to see it trashed - there's no other word for it - it was trashed.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-68345447,London's working class projects receive Â£180k in grants,2024,"initiatives given funding include ones focusing on local protests, homelessness in a 'cardboard city', and a rastafari community at a squat

heritage projects across the capital are set to receive a share of a â£180,000 grant from historic england.

nursery workers' strikes, homelessness in a 'cardboard city', and a rastafari community at a long-running squat are among the eight projects to benefit.

tom foxall from historic england said the awardees ""shine an important light on our working class heritage"".

the group's everyday heritage programme set up in 2022 aims to showcase the diversity of england's heritage.

it is part of the organisation's commitment to ""ensuring that a wider range of people are able to connect with, enjoy and benefit from the historic environment"".

so far 57 projects across england have received funding, with a further 56 - including the eight in london - forming the newest list of recipients.

non-profit cooperative organisation on the record will receive more than â£12,000 for its plans to record and share the history of the islington nursery workers' strike 40 years ago, when roughly 160 people went on strike.

following the strikes the workers secured improvements in the standard of care given to children

the workers were predominantly women - many from minority ethnic backgrounds - who were calling for a lower ratio of staff to children in the nurseries.

following two strikes in 1984 and 1989 workers secured improvements in the standard of care given to children and created a better working environment for themselves.

this research may be turned into a podcast, a piece of radio theatre or an audio walking tour linking the nursery sites.

kingswood arts has been awarded â£25,000 to work with local people over 12 months to create a permanent exhibition exploring the working-class history of kingswood house from 1811 to the present day.

nearby residents will record their experiences at the grade ii listed victorian 'castle' in the middle of a council estate near sydenham hill station.

injured canadian soldiers stayed at kingswood house when it was used as the massey-harris convalescent home

the initiative aims to trace working-class life through its time as a private house to a wartime hospital, and later as a library and community centre.

eastside community heritage has been awarded more than â£21,000 to mark the history of aspiring bands from working class backgrounds at the bridge house pub in canning town from 1975 to 1982.

the venue became a leading live music destination and hosted an eclectic mix of music from iron maiden to dire straits and chas & dave to depeche mode, as well as boosting the profile of bands like paul youngs' q-tips.

taken early on a monday morning after a long weekend of gigging, this q tips promotional shot became known as 'the hangover shot'

bridge house also became one of the first pubs to launch its own record label.

as part of the project, oral histories and pop-up exhibitions are planned to capture the stories of people who came to socialise, listen to live music and perform.

historic england has given almost â£25,000 for a project led by artists and people with experience of homelessness looking at 'cardboard city', an encampment made from hundreds of cardboard boxes in the underpasses between waterloo station and the south bank.

a bench dedicated to the homeless community will form a key part of the cardboard city project

the area housed thousands of rough sleepers over 20 years in the 1980s and 1990s, but st john's church charity the bridge at waterloo said many of those who lived there are now in poor health or have passed away.

the groups now want to remember and memorialise what they call the ""neglected heritage of homeless people in the area"" by speaking with former residents of cardboard city, those who supported them, and local residents and researching objects linked to the time.

china exchange has also been given nearly â£25,000 in funding to explore the hidden stories of people working in chinatown from 1985 to the present day when the area is home to more than 150 diverse businesses.

china exchange said chinatown is a place of work for thousands of ethnically, culturally and socially diverse londoners

the cultural events organisation is planning to reveal and share stories of ordinary workers in chinatown including short and long-form recorded interviews.

house of dread's project will explore and document the untold stories of the rastafari community in what is thought to be london's longest-running squat at st agnes place in kennington.

the squat existed for more than three decades and became a meeting point for the rastafari community and by the 1980s became locally known as house of dread.

now historian dr aleema gray and a group of community producers will work with rastafari movement uk to coordinate a series of community conversations and collecting days.

they have been awarded â£24,980, with the goal of making a digital learning resource to examine how and why st agnes place evolved.

tom foxall, historic england regional director, said: ""there are so many hidden histories to uncover here in london. every community has a story to tell and we want to hear them.

""this is the strength of our everyday heritage grant programme, which funds projects that are community-led and really engage with local people by empowering them to research and tell their own stories.""

a ballot of 10,000 london underground (lu) staff has been moved by the rail, maritime and transport (rmt) union after more than a year of negotiations.

the union said lu had failed to produce an offer on pay that meets the ""very reasonable"" demands of the workforce.

the rmt called on london mayor sadiq khan and his tfl officials to lift a cap on pay and allow a deal to be done.

""staff are putting in enormous efforts to keep london moving against a backdrop of overcrowding, creaking infrastructure and surging levels of violence and assaults,"" it said.

transport for london said it rewarded the hard work of staff

general secretary mick cash said the city was a ""wealthy business centre and those staff who work round the clock to keep the city moving deserve their fair share"".

""after over a year of intensive talks aimed at reaching a negotiated settlement on tube pay, rmt reps are angry and frustrated that london underground have now stalled that process and failed to come up with an offer that would fully recognise the efforts of their workforce,"" he said.

although all the surprise pieces have now been unveiled, speculation over the inspiration behind them persists. what do they mean, and how have they been received by the art and graffiti worlds?

banksy's final piece, outside london zoo in camden, north london, shows a gorilla lifting the shutter to release a sea lion and birds, while other animals appear to look on from the inside.

by day three, online speculation was rife as to whether the series had a deeper meaning.

could the black goat speak to being on the precipice of something bigger?

perhaps the goat was a metaphor for standing on the edge of a moment of change, or the two elephants were reaching across from different sides of something? maybe the three monkeys represented the ""wise monkeys"" in the japanese proverb of the ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"" fame?

the three monkeys hanging off a bridge is one of the few works which hasn't been defaced or removed

theories have ranged from the series focusing onsocial division amidst recent riots, to the israel-gaza conflict.

james ryan, ceo of grove gallery which sells banksy originals and prints, told bbc london he initially thought the works had ""politically charged and motivated messages, so the goat - references to palestine and gaza, and then the wolf crying for help - some kind of persecution"".

since the final piece was revealed, however, he believes there is a theme of ""incarceration; animals being trapped"" in the series.

the last in the series shows a gorilla enabling the ""grand great escape"" which explains why there were animals all over london, says banksy expert james peak

mr ryan added while there were new elements to banksy's campaign such as building momentum by posting a daily ""teaser"" on social media, there were also references to his previous work with the gorilla piece being reminiscent of his 2006 ""sweep it under the carpet"" work depicting a maid with a dustpan and brush which was also painted in north london.

mr ryan said parallels could be drawn between banksy's gorilla piece and his 2006 work sweep it under the carpet

itâs not the first time the street artist has delivered a series of daily works, as he previously used the format for hisstaycation series in east anglia, in new orleans andduring his month-long new york ""residency"".

his 2009 exhibition banksy vs bristol museum featured installations of animals doing human activities

james peak, presenter of the bbcâsthe banksy story, explained the artist was ""very keen on animal welfare"" and ""helped greenpeace out with a campaign a few years ago"".

he said the artist also made ecological themes part of his work in the past, writing cardboard placards and throwing them into the ape enclosures at longleat and melbourne zoo in australia, ""so the apes were holding up bits of cardboard saying things like 'please help me iâm the victim of a cruel scientific experiment' or even 'iâm a celebrity get me out of here'.""

banksy has long used rats, like this one believed to have been painted in 2004 and which has since been partially covered over by a ""sticker tagger"", in his street art when he wants to make political or social commentary

sunday's artwork, piranhas in a police box, was moved to guildhall yard for ""safe-keeping""

he added banksy campaigns ""often only really make sense backwards"".

this series could simply represent ""this grand great escape that the gorilla has caused from london zoo, which explains why there are all these animals over london this last week"", he said.

or it could have ""a really serious kind of point to it - maybe that weâre not doing enough to ensure animals globally have enough natural space,"" he added.

the pieces havenât been without their share of problems either.

the howling wolf sprayed on a satellite dish in peckham, south-east london, wasseemingly taken by thieves.

a man walks off with the banksy-adorned satellite dish in tow

two others were removed by london authorities, with the first - a silhouette of a cat painted on a billboard on edgware road in cricklewood - wastaken down for safety reasons.

the city of london corporation said the other painted on 11 august - swimming piranhas on a city of london police sentry box - had been taken to guildhall yard so it could be viewed safely.

the cat was removed by contractors, one of whom said it was in case someone ""ripped it down and left it unsafe""

two more were defaced, including the two elephants which received some spray-painted white stripes.

however, it is the vandalism on the second-to-last artwork, of a rhinoceros (originally mounting a nissan micra with a traffic cone on its bonnet) in charlton, south-east london, which resurrected an old feud between banksy and hisrevered rival robbo.

'sv', which appears to stand for south vandals, was sprayed over banksy's rhinoceros

ahmad karkouti, from graffiti and street art podcast arms house to your mums house, told bbc london the white s, or a dollar sign, and a v sign stood for a local graffiti crew called south vandals.

he added he received footage of the defacing with the message ""south vandals 4 life! team robbo"".

mr karkouti explained the late robbo, who was from london, was inspired by differences in the way socially acceptable street art was appreciated compared to traditional graffiti, which was widely regarded as criminal damage.

while hidden meanings and wider battles are still up for debate, one thing clear in enthusiasts' eyes is that banksy has successfully grabbed the world's attention - again.

mr ryan said the series has ""had the desired effect that he wanted"", to ""create this theatre"" which ""reaffirms"" his status as a ""trendsetter"".

âthis campaign has been eight, nine days and itâs fantastic. itâs got all of london and all of the uk talking.""

commuters travelling from london king's cross will face significant disruption as engineering works are carried out.

no long-distance services will run on the east coast main line (ecml) to or from king's cross between saturday and tuesday, network rail said.

work is normally carried out on weekends and bank holidays with fewer commuters but network rail has relaxed this policy on the ecml.

officials said signalling was being upgraded.

engineering work affecting king's cross was also carried out last weekend.

network rail said doing the work over two weekends and two weekdays avoids disrupting up to five consecutive weekends.

the project is part of a â£1bn scheme to upgrade and digitise signalling.

ricky barsby, head of access and integration for network rail's east coast digital programme, said this month's engineering work at the southern end of the ecml was ""a significant milestone"" for the project and would mean ""smoother and more reliable journeys for passengers"".

he also thanked passengers for their ""patience and understanding"".

affected operators lner, hull trains, lumo and grand central said in a joint statement: ""our teams will be working extremely hard to ensure passengers reach their destination as quickly as possible while these upgrades are carried out.

""the latest travel information can be found on our websites and on our social media platforms and we advise passengers to plan ahead and check before they travel.""

the operators advised passengers to check their websites and social media for the latest travel information.

drivers have been told to avoid a central london bridge next week when it closes for essential maintenance work.

kensington and chelsea council said albert bridge will close in both directions from 07:00 bst on 28 may until 07:00 on 1 june.

some of the individual timber panels along the grade ii listed structure will be replaced during the closure.

work is also expected to be carried out to the bridgeâs lighting and ornamental features known as festoons.

a diversion will be in place for drivers via chelsea bridge or battersea bridge.

works will also be taking place to the pavements but will be done in stages to ensure access for pedestrians at all times, the council said.

cyclists have been encouraged to dismount.

cem kemahli, lead member of planning and public realm at the council, said: ""albert bridge is an icon of the london skyline but itâs also an important river crossing.

""as a responsible guardian of the bridge, itâs crucial that we undertake essential maintenance so we can keep the bridge in good health and keep it operational now and in the future.

""weâre sorry for the short-term inconvenience this will cause to some drivers and their journeys and we hope we can limit some of this by doing the work during the half term holidays.""

the council has also reminded the drivers of goods vehicles to avoid the bridge at all times if they weigh more than the three-tonne limit in place since january this year.

the council said it issued 2,811 fines in april alone, equalling â£365,000, according to analysis by thelocal democracy reporting service.

the council said the fines are issued based on the vehicleâs official revenue weight, also known as the maximum gross weight, which drivers can check on the dvla website.

since january, hauliers breaching the three-tonne limit can expect to be fined â£130.

sian berry joined the green party 20 years ago after ""developing a conscience"" while working for a pharmaceutical company. ms berry, who is making her third attempt to become mayor of london, explains how she wants to run the capital from ""the bottom up"" after being ""the average londoner"" for most of her adult life.

""i've always worked,"" ms berry said. ""i've worked since i was 14 because i needed to.""

now 46 years old, ms berry is the co-leader of the green party, a london assembly member and a councillor. she also volunteers at her local library.

her route to political prominence has not been straightforward, and it was driven by a need ""to keep the lights on"", she said.

""when i came to london all i had was my overdraft and my degree. i started working in offices as a temp because i'd learned to type in a previous job.""

sadiq khan: 'i neverâ wanted to be a culture war poster boy'

shaun bailey: 'politics isn't scary when you've seen stabbings'

luisa porritt: 'this is one glass ceiling yet to be shattered'

what do the mayor of london manifestos say?

after graduating with a degree in materials science from oxford university, she says her most employable skill was ""being good at excel and doing mail merges"".

ms berry ended up working as a medical writer ""writing to doctors on how different cold medicines work"".

""after a few years i developed a conscience,"" she said. ""it was a really, really interesting job, but in the end i was working for a big pharmaceutical company.

""some of the work i was doing was trying to market drugs for things that shouldn't necessarily be medicalised.""

ms berry said she ""very gradually moved to becoming someone who full time tried to change the world""

through watching the news and reading up on climate change she ""started to learn how the world worked"".

""i made a conscious decision to change my career and i don't regret it.""

it was at about this time she started attending protests and marches in london.

""i would pick up leaflets from everybody and take them home and read them. that was the first time i was ever in contact with the green party.""

after her self-described ""quarter-life crisis"" ms berry began working for charities ""learning an awful lot about campaigning"" and ""filling in gaps in what the government provide"".

ms berry said her political awakening came through attending protests in london

her experiences inspired her to start running for political roles and branching out into activism.

ms berry ran for camden council first in 2002.

at about this same time, she founded the alliance against urban 4ã4s, which received national attention after she began leaving fake parking tickets on cars around camden and westminster.

during this period she began working as a web designer at the department of medicine at imperial college, london.

when her unit at imperial span off to become a tech start-up, she was eyeing up her first bid for the top job in london.

she ran for mayor of london in 2008, coming in fourth and losing her deposit.

sian berry is co-leader of the green party alongside jonathon bartley

but her star was rising within the green party. alongside writing several books on living a more eco-friendly life, she held a series of spokesperson roles.

others were taking notice of her activities as a campaigner.

the met police began secretly monitoring ms berry, along with other key green party members, according toa newspaper investigation.,external

she declined to comment on the experience. but at the time she accused the police of ""wasting time and our money snooping on green politicians and campaigners who they think might want to change the status quo"".

in 2014 ms berry eventually won a seat on camden council. two years later she won a seat on the london assembly, where she now  sits as one of two green party representatives.

in 2018 she became co-leader of the green party along with jonathon bartley.

ms berry said: ""i very gradually moved to becoming someone who full time tried to change the world.

what's happening:on 6 may, people will vote to elect a mayor and 25 members of the london assembly. together they form the greater london authority, which governs the capital.

why does it matter?the mayor has a â£19bn budget, is responsible for transport and policing and has a role in housing, planning and the environment. the london assembly holds the mayor to account.find out more here.

""i know what genuinely running out of money means. i know exactly how much â£20 can mean to you at the end of the month.

""it's just the empathy i can have with people is just bigger because of having lived this very normal life.""

as mayor, ms berry said she would get more ""normal people"" involved in decision-making.

""we want to make sure ideas on how we change society come from the bottom.

the blockade began at 1500 bst leading to delays near the strand and roads leading to and from waterloo bridge.

drivers drove around the aldwych roundabout leading to long queues.

the hour-long protest had a knock-on effect on traffic in the run-up to rush hour.

however, some firms, such as amazon, are requiring staff toreturn to the office five days a weekbut there have been reports that staff have made anonymous complaints online about the policy.

amazon boss andy jassy wrote to staff in september to say office working allowed it to ""better invent, collaborate and be connected enough to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business"".

the policy was due to begin with the return to work in january, however, an insider told the bbc they were not able to enforce the five days-a-week rule due to a current lack of desk space.

amazon has disputed this and said all employees were back in the office full-time.

amazon is not alone in asking employees to return to office working.

the metropolitan police has introduced a new hybrid working policy which requires civilian staff to work a minimum of three days a week in the office.

intelligence analyst anna bruce-hou, who has worked at home three days a week since covid, is one of more than 5,000 staff affected. she is vice-president of the public and commercial services (pcs) union and is one of the 2,400 members of who have begun industrial action in protest at the policy.

speaking to bbc london, she said working in the office for an extra day a week ""would have a negative impact on my ability to do my job"".

""in my office there are four desks and seven people, and even now with the reduction in office attendance i can struggle to find a desk,"" she said.

anna bruce-hou, an intelligence analyst for the met police, is fighting against losing her right to work at home three days a week

the metropolitan police said the policy, which came into effect on monday, ""did not end working from home"" and that it was aware some staff may have legitimate reasons for not following the policy due to agreed reasonable adjustment or an approved existing flexible working plan.

""our plans will provide consistency across the met and ensure we can deliver for our communities. we urge our staff and the union not to take further action,"" a spokesperson said.

they added that those who continued to work from home for more than two days a week might be in breach of their contract and could lose pay.

within the last year, a number of large london-based employers have reviewed their working policies and restricted or banned working from home.

wpp, a global communications agency, announced on tuesday it was tightening its rules and would require staff to be in four days a week from april.

ceo mark read said to staff in a letter: ""the data from across wpp agencies shows that higher levels of office attendance are associated with stronger employee engagement, improved client survey scores and better financial performance.""

he added: ""more of our clients are moving in this direction and expecting it of the teams who work with them.""

it has also been reported,externalthat a number of other large employers in london have asked some staff to return to five days a week in the office, but some firms have told the bbc the return-to-office policies only applied to certain teams.

david palmer, an employment lawyer, said there was no law stopping companies bringing staff in to the office five days a week

the question of how and whether to enforce employees to spend more time in the office is one that is being debated by companies across the capital.

david palmer, an employment lawyer at law firm addleshaw goddard, told the bbc that over the last six months, he had seen an increase in the number of queries from businesses who were considering a mandate in returning to the office.

""there's no law against a general policy that says employees must come in and work five days a week in their office, but there are considerations around reasonable adjustments for those with disabilities, consideration of indirect discriminations risks,"" he said.

mr palmer added the main consideration for companies should be ""the attraction and retention of talent"" and that would ""depend on business to business"".

could staff monitors via surveillance cameras be used by companies to ensure staff are at their desks?

companies wishing to bring staff into the office more permanently are now considering the best ways to ensure staff are present.

asurvey of 150 financial services companies,externalwas conducted in september last year by kpmg, which found that bosses were considering a range of methods to track attendance in the office.

companies said they would consider using monitoring devices, such as cameras in the office or even under-desk sensors to ensure employees were at work.

for some companies though, incentives are being used to encourage employees back into the work place instead.

just eat for business, who ask staff to be in the office three days a week, offer an allowance for free food every month.

managing director matt ephgrave said the idea was ""very affordable"" for the firm.

""we're all human, so it creates a moment where you can sit down, you can have a conversation with people you might not otherwise speak to,"" he said.

maddie scoular at just eat for business said she really missed coming into the office

the centre for citiesconducted research into londoners returning to the office,externalin september last year.

it reported: ""central london office workers have continued to return to the office since last year.

""days in for full-time workers have increased from 2.2 days in spring 2023 to 2.7 in summer 2024.""

but, it said london's return to the office had been ""slow by global standards"".

property consultancy firm bidwells surveyed 400 employers in london last april and found that the commute to work was one of the main disincentives for going into the office.

mark callender, who worked on the research, said of those surveyed: ""what we see is most people going into office on tuesday, wednesday and thursday.

""but, on a monday it's only half and on a friday it's even lower, it's about 40%.""

he added: ""a lot of it does have to do with time spent commuting, over a third of people in london said it takes them more than an hour.""

community groups recording air pollution in london found eight out of nine areas surveyed breached eu limits for nitrogen dioxide (no2) in the air.

the university college london (ucl) project found the highest level of no2 in the areas was in marylebone in central london.

diesel vehicles are a key source of no2, which is linked to a range of respiratory illnesses.

london's deputy mayor for environment and energy said no2 was a ""problem"".

an ultra low emission zone, which will only allow zero and low-emission vehicles in central london, is being introduced in 2020

the results are part of the social enterprisemapping for change,external's air quality monitoring project.

community groups were given kits to measure the amount of no2 in july in areas including marylebone, soho, walthamstow, brentford, haringey and ham.

the highest reading was on marylebone road, in central london, measuring 145 micrograms of no2 per cubic meter air (âµg/m3), which is nearly four times the eu legal limit of 40âµg/m3.

this was followed by shaftesbury avenue, in soho, at 119âµg/m3.

public health england suggests about 3,000 people each year are estimated to die from polluted air in the capital

tests in suburban areas like walthamstow and brentford also showed nearly double the eu limit.

louise francis, from ucl and co-founder of mapping for change, said the results were a snapshot of the level of pollution in the capital but the actual levels of no2 could be higher as holiday levels were often lower than other times of the year.

she said that the public could make changes to reduce their intake of no2 by walking down side roads instead of major routes.

matthew pencharz, deputy mayor for environment and energy, said: ""no2 remains a problem. we have now seen a 12% reduction in measured no2 across london showing we are making real progress.""

he added that the introduction of taxi age limits and cleaner buses had also improved air quality, as would the introduction in 2020 of theultra low emission zone (ulez),external, which will only allow zero and low-emission vehicles in central london.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckg2d1v5yyxo,Inside HS2: Meet London's tunnelling miners,2025,"liam clarke and his father graham are miners on a tunnel boring machine

it is loud, dusty and 30m (about 98ft) underground - this is the domain of the london miner.

we are on a tunnel boring machine (tbm) inside high speed two's huge northolt tunnels.

these tunnel-boring machines are part of a tunnelling renaissance that is creating a new, mainly hidden, london.

they have been used to drill the silvertown tunnel, crossrail, the power tunnels in north london and the thames tideway or super sewer as well as the channel tunnel.

operating these machines are teams of miners who come from all over the world and move from project to project.

the miners are a pretty unassuming lot and don't really think what they're doing is unusual.

they work shifts of anything between seven and 12 hours. the tbm does not stop, crawling along at 16m (about 52ft) a day and runs 24/7.

graham clark and his son liam are from kent.

graham says he first got into mining due to the channel tunnel: ""i was just asked if i wanted to go down the tunnel being a local labourer.""

he says he carried on ever since, after getting six years' work on the channel tunnel.

liam says: ""my old man got me into the game. i just finished school, i got a phone call he was working away at the time, he said, 'right you're starting with me tomorrow'.

""and that was it. worked away from home ever since then. for the last 14 years or so.""

""it's challenging and can be hard work but you have a good crew and you all work together and everyone helps each other out. and you work for the team, different challenges but yes it's good.""

jack doherty, like a lot of miners is from donegal in ireland. he says it is very much like any other construction site.

""there's a big tunnelling community back home where i'm from,"" said jack.

""a lot of the young lads here, most of their dads are in it. it runs in families a bit from where i'm from anyway it does. ""

living quarters for miners including toaster and microwave

at the mouth of every tunnel there is a small shrine to saint barbara, the patron saint of miners.

to get to the boring machine we are driven for an hour in a buggy in the tunnel. it can quickly get hot down there.

the northolt tunnels are currently 93% complete.

we visited when they were hours from breaking through to the shaft at greenford.

four machines were homing in the shaft from the south-east and the north-west with huge conveyor belts taking the spoil along the length of the tunnel.

these machines will then be hauled out and decommissioned.

michael greiner is the head of tunnelling at scs jv.

i met him previously at the start of the project where he told me that ""a lot of things have gone well but in tunnelling there's also exciting things"" such as the ""quite heterogeneous"" geology.

he said: ""we are mining along the london basin and so geology from chalk, flint, a mix of sand.

""the geology has some surprises so you never know exactly what is happening underground, so it kept us busy.""

this tunnel section between rusilip and greenford is 5 miles (8km) long and straight

the tbms are hugely complex pieces of kit and the ground conditions have caused some problems.

underneath ruislip rugby club they hit sandy ground which causedlarge clouds of foamto end up on the rugby pitches which had to be closed.

at the time jatin radia, the club's chairman, told us: ""the reality is it does cause further concerns because you've got local residents, local rugby club members. they're naturally concerned about what's going on and asking, 'is it safe?'.""

in the most part no-one above ground had any idea what had been going on beneath them, according to hs2's head of delivery, james leeming.

""a lot of people who live in west london, we may have mined 25m (about 82ft) beneath their houses and their places and their streets and they wouldn't have been any the wiser as to what was going on down here,"" he said.

he thinks the success of the tunnelling so far bodes well for completing the tunnel to euston.

""it's really positive to achieve what we have done on this section of the tunnel, but we have still got an awful lot to do both this year and it's going to one of the most productive years on the civil contracts.

""this really sets us in a good place for delivering the euston tunnel.""

the economic contribution of older londoners said that of the two million people aged over 50, 19% generated â£47bn for the economy through work.

it also found the age group offered 64 million free childcare hours per year.

the mayor of london's office, which commissionedthe report,external, said it was about ""dispelling stereotypes"".

boris johnson's office used data to study demographics, employment, care figures and volunteering statistics to ""dispel stereotypes that older people are a burden on their families and the public purse"".

the report found that of the proportion of older men working full-time in london, 82% were working full-time, compared to 88% of younger men.

for older women, the research suggested that 56% of older women were working full-time compared to 67% in younger women.

the older generation tended to have jobs in the health and education sectors and of those aged 50-69 who were not in employment, about 13% had looked for a job in a four-week period.

it also found that about 16% of older londoners were providing unpaid care for adults with most offering about 33 hours per week.

while less than 10% of the one million london families with children used grandparental childcare, those that did used it for 15 hours per week or 760 per year equating to about â£600m per year, the report said.

an artwork appearing on the shutters of london zoo has been confirmed as the latest and final image in banksy's surprise animal art trail across the capital.

it shows a gorilla lifting the shutter to release a sea lion and birds, while other animals appear to look on from the inside.

it is the ninth banksy to appear in as many days in london and follows images that have popped up each morning since 5 august of agoat,elephants,monkeys, awolf,pelicans, acat,piranhasand arhinoceros.

a london zoo spokesperson said it was ""absolutely brilliant"" and said the work would be preserved.

people have gathered to photograph the mural from behind a barrier that has been installed

daniel simmonds, london zoo's animal operations manager, said: ""banksy has become part of the london scene and itâs really nice to share his iconic status with, ultimately, one of the most iconic zoos in the entire world.

""weâre quite honoured he's chosen to use our front shutters this morning to put one of his incredible artworks.

""i think itâs absolutely brilliant,"" he told bbc news.

he said staff had no idea banksy was planning the work at this location.

""that's part of the amazing enigma of banksy and thatâs why itâs so exciting to come in this morning,"" mr simmonds added.

security guards have been brought in to secure a barrier that has been put up around the mural.

mr simmonds said the shutter would remain closed today and two others used instead, so that visitors could look at the work.

""itâs really important we share this with everybody.""

he added he was expecting extra people to visit on tuesday in addition to the thousands who had already booked.

mr simmons later confirmed that the artwork would be protected.

""we'll definitely preserve it. we might even look at putting some perspex around it.

""the last thing we want with typical london weather, having just come through one of the worst winters ever, is to see this damaged by the weather.""

he added it was likely to remain in the same location for the immediate future but might then be relocated to elsewhere on the site.

the nissan micra and traffic cone that formed part of this banksy artwork in charlton have been removed

the pledge to protect the latest image follows the removal or partial defacing of several other works in the series.

banksy's depiction of a rhinoceros mounting a nissan micra with a traffic cone on its bonnet in charlton was seen being sprayed with a white dollar and ""v"" sign on monday, soon after it was unveiled.

royal borough of greenwich said it was ""a real shame that a mindless vandal has defaced the mural, which has already drawn visitors and brought so much joy to many.

""the council is now considering what would be reasonably possible for the future of the artwork and will be closely monitoring it.""

a worker has since been seen installing a protective cover over the mural on westmoor street.

the car and traffic cone have been removed. however, it is not known why or who was responsible.

last week, a satellite dish with a picture of a howling wolf on it - the fourth image in the series - wasapparently stolenfrom a garage roof in peckham.

and a disused billboard in cricklewood that featured banksy's image of a stretching cat - the sixth image of the series - wastaken down for safety reasons.

the bbc has been told by banksy's team the latest work is the final piece of the series, which has captured the attention of banksy followers for more than a week.

the artist appears to have installed the works overnight at each occasion.

crowds have been seen gathering after passers-by have spotted the works each morning, with many posting photos on social media.

typically, banksy has confirmed he is behind the creations at 13:00 bst each day, however, he announced the latest work on hisinstagram,externalpage on tuesday morning.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly9d48lv17o,Inside the unlicensed HMOs housing migrant workers,2025,"council enforcement officer lisa smith waits for someone to open the door at a suspected hmo

it's barely light on a street in leytonstone, east london, as a team of enforcement officers from the london borough of waltham forest knocks on a front door. the  house is suspected to be an unlicensed home in multiple occupation (hmo).

the team has allowed me and a colleague to come with them and film.

an eastern european tenant in his dressing gown opened the door to us and on seeing the warrant, allowed us access.

he tried to call the landlord, whose son lives here, to let him know what was happening.

the man didn't want to be identified, but he told me he paid about â£600 a month for a small, windowless bedroom on the ground floor.

he works 12-hour shifts as a concierge in a luxury apartment block.

a warrant for entry from the magistrates' court was left for the absent landlord

he was one of seven or more unrelated people living in what should have been a three-bedroom terraced house, and he had been living here for six months. he didn't have to pay a deposit.

all the tenants worked shifts in london and shared a kitchen and two bathrooms.

there was no living or dining room, but there was a large kitchen the residents shared. the smoke alarms were not working, and nor were the landing lights on the first floor.

on the first floor, another tenant opened the door to his bedroom, which had a feline litter tray outside. he was also eastern european and had been living there since 2017.

his cat, he said, was to keep the mice at bay. on the wages he earns he told us, he could not afford to live anywhere else.

this house was recently refused an hmo licence by waltham forest. it was visited unannounced six times over the summer by the housing enforcement team, and the landlord now claims he lives here with two lodgers.

there isa public register,externalfor licensed hmos in the borough, and this property wasn't on it. it's not known how many unlicensed hmos there are in waltham forest, but enforcement officers often carry out intelligence-led inspections.

over the past 10 years the local authority has secured 325 criminal prosecutions, or financial penalties of up to â£30,000, for each offence relating to poor quality housing.

but it doesn't stop some landlords from squeezing as many tenants as possible into properties not built to accommodate them.

an extension lead was seen attached directly into socket holes, without a plug, while charging batteries

at the front of the house was a locked room, which the first tenant said belonged to the landlord's son.

eventually the locksmith the team brought with them opened the door to allow the enforcement officers entry.

the room contained a double bed, a dresser and a desk. what appeared to be car or e-scooter batteries were charging from a plug socket near the door.

the wires were attached from an extension lead directly into the socket holes, without a plug. the team were concerned this was a fire hazard, and made a note.

they left a copy of the warrant on the bed, and the locksmith closed the room back up.

the first tenant we met told us he's moving out. he hoped his new room in his new house would be better.

council enforcement officers arrived with a warrant at a property in walthamstow

we drove to a second address, this time in walthamstow, on a residential street of terraced houses close to the high road.

the council enforcement team believed there could be eight tenants living at this address. they soon found there were significantly more.

an afghan man opened the door and didn't want to let us in, but once he saw the warrant, he relented.

he said he had refugee status and had applied for housing but hasn't been given anywhere. he told me he paid â£250 a month to share a room with another man, also a refugee from afghanistan, who also paid â£250.

he agreed that we could  interview him on camera, but only if i didn't show his face.

he told me he worked long hours in a laundry, but was currently at home after he had an accident at work. he had some cuts and bruises on his face and arms. he showed me a photo of himself recovering in a london hospital.

he and his friend told me they spent many nights sleeping rough, in parks, on trains and in mosques. this room, they said, was better than that.

there appeared to be at least 13 tenants living here, from all over the world.

three men from pakistan said hello to us in the kitchen.

it's their living arrangements - not their immigration status - which interested the team.

this property also did not have an hmo licence. the enforcement team had made multiple unannounced visits over the summer, as well as serving a section 239 notification under the housing act 2004, but they weren't able to gain access.

everyone living here seemed to be working. these are the waiters, delivery drivers and labourers keeping london going.

one of the bathrooms in the property had a dilapidated shower

there was only one working bathroom on the ground floor, shared between all 13 of the residents.

it had a shower which was not plumbed in properly and had a leak, causing damp and mould.

another was on the first floor and had a working toilet but a dilapidated shower which someone has recently tried to use, with a mop and sponge next to it.

someone had left a packet of cigarettes on the windowsill.

downstairs the kitchen was filthy, mouldy and damp, with cockroach droppings in the cupboard under the sink. a wire net covered part of the ceiling plaster which had come loose, directly beneath the upstairs shower room.

the plug sockets were loose and there were wires sticking out.

there was no communal living area apart from the kitchen.

it didn't have working smoke alarms, and the bannister rails and stairs were in disrepair. it also had an extra storey for which it didn't have planning permission.

sandra mcgrath said: ""the tenants are really battling against odds.

""these are all communal facilities and so we would expect the landlord to keep things in good condition.

""people want to live in a comfortable environment but with so many people living under one roof it's creating additional fire risks.

""it's a three-storey property and someone who is sleeping on the second floor is really in danger of not being able to get out safely.""

the locksmith opened the door into a single bedroom. a filthy bed had no sheets although it was clear someone had been sleeping on the grubby mattress.

the room smelt dreadful and it was clear the occupant sleeps, eats, maybe even cooks there.

there's a window which opened wide at floor level.

enforcement officer ms mcgrath said it was ""incredibly dangerous"".

""if a child came into this room. can you imagine the risk that they are in?""

but there was a smart wool suit covered in a clear polythene bag hanging up on a nail on the wall and a gentleman's umbrella next to it. this person clearly worked, and dressed accordingly.

looking out across the gardens from the first floor window, a few doors down there was what appeared to be another hmo - future investigation work for the team.

for today though, they have enough paperwork to process.

""we've found an unlicensed hmo with at least 10 people living there, possibly more,"" said enforcement officer lisa smith.

""we will be continuing our investigation and taking enforcement action.""

when they had gone, we had got one more stop. one of the residents had told me the landlord lived nearby.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10407537,Up to 1.5m drivers 'fined illegally' in London,2010,"more than a million drivers have been fined in three years

up to â£150m in fines given to motorists for traffic offences may have been unlawful, bbc london has learned.

in 2009 a motorist fined for taking an illegal turn had his penalty quashed because of the wording on his ticket.

it has now led to questions over millions of tickets issued in similar circumstances.

local councils and transport for london (tfl) have erected hundreds of signs stopping drivers from making left or right turns or carrying out other manoeuvres classed as ""moving"" traffic offences.

in the last three years about 1.5 million motorists have been fined â£120 for not obeying the ""moving"" traffic signs.

in the test case, which has just emerged, motorist zeesham sheikh challenged a ticket issued by waltham forest council for failing to comply with such a sign.

the parking and traffic appeals service (patas) upheld mr sheikh's appeal.

the adjudicator found that the wording on the ticket referred to the sign itself and not to the traffic order that legally gave it power.

for technical legal reasons patas ruled that mentioning the sign alone on the ticket was not sufficient to enforce the fine.

london councils, which represents the city's local authorities, wrote the wording which was then printed on tickets issued across the city.

parking campaigner barrie segal, who helped bring the issue to light, claims the ruling means any tickets issued with that wording were not enforceable.

he said: ""millions of pounds of london penalty charge notices are illegal.

""tfl and other local authorities will have to cancel all outstanding tickets issued and refund millions of pounds illegally claimed.""

after the adjudicator's ruling london councils amended its recommended wording for tickets issued over moving traffic offences.

that happened in october 2009 but mr segal believes any tickets issued before that date could be challenged.

moving traffic signs include those which prohibit right and left turns, u-turns, entry to and waiting in pedestrian zones and signs which prohibit motorcycles and sometimes cars in certain areas.

in 2007, 418,512 moving traffic tickets were issued in london, rising to 611,130 in 2008 with 418,512 awarded last year, totalling â£150m in fines.

nick lester, director of services for london councils, said: ""i don't know why they cancelled it [mr sheikh's ticket].

""but the adjudicator's decision does not act as a legal precedent.""

he insisted drivers who paid up in similar circumstances were too late to reclaim money, adding: ""if they don't appeal against the ticket the council has a right to say they accept culpability.""

mr lester said that, while they changed the wording, they did not accept the original phrasing was wrong.

transport for london has also been issuing fines to motorists who have not been following the signs.

a tfl spokesman said: ""tfl has complied with legislation and it is up to any individual to challenge a penalty charge notice within the appropriate time scale.""

waltham forest council said it was examining the ruling.

london councils have spent nearly â£100m on safety measures in the year since the grenfell disaster, figures show.

some councils say they have had to delay refurbishing council flats to pay for the fire safety work.

croydon council says a lack of government funding has caused it to cut refurbishment work to pay for sprinklers installation in high rises.

police and fire service minister nick hurd said primary responsibility for fire safety work lay with landlords.

the nearly â£100m in spending, declared by 24 boroughs in response to bbc freedom of information requests, paid for cladding removal, operating ""waking watches"" on buildings that were found to be at risk of fire, safety surveys and other improvements.

however, some boroughs are still finding new safety issues a year after the disaster.

in barnet, north london, the agency that runs social housing for the council found 1,183 fire doors installed in its flats do not provide enough resistance to fire and will need need to be replaced.

the manse masterdor fire doors were only installed in 2013 and 2014 and will cost â£1.5m to replace.

resident malcolm sweetland said it would have been nice to spend the money on refurbishments

malcolm sweetland, who lives in one of these flats, said it was a pity so much money would have to be spent on the doors rather than other improvements, but understood why it had to happen.

""in the long run, it's better safe than sorry, isn't it?"" he said.

camden council has spent â£33m since the disaster, while newham has paid out â£20m.

kensington and chelsea says it has spent â£4.6m on fire safety improvement work, and has separately spent â£235m in responding to the grenfell disaster directly so far, exhausting its reserves.

barry craker says he is glad to see the work being done

in croydon the council has taken the decision to begin retrofitting sprinklers in its high rise blocks.

barry craker, a resident in beech house, new addington, said he was happy to have sprinklers.

""it's good, you need it done for security and safety. hopefully we won't have to use them any time soon.""

however, the council says that to install the sprinklers it has had to make cuts elsewhere.

grenfell tower fire: who were the victims?

grenfell mental health treatment 'to cost â£10m'

alison butler, cabinet member for housing, said: ""we are funding this â£10m in sprinkler work, because we are determined to do that, but that does mean that other things we hope to do, to keep our flats decent, will have to suffer and wait in the long term.""

enfield and brent councils have also had applications for government funding to fit sprinklers turned down, while newham says it has yet to receive any money from the ministry for housing, communities and local government for its safety work.

minister nick hurd said landlords in genuine financial need should approach the government

criminal gangs are producing potentially lethal alcohol and selling it in the capital, a bbc investigation has discovered.

bbc london's inside outinfiltrated two groups, one of which was targeting rough sleepers and illegal immigrants with unregulated alcohol.

one illegal still in west london said it was making â£500 a month in sales.

hm revenue and customs (hmrc) said the production of illegal alcohol was a ""dangerous activity"".

the bbc london investigation found eight illegal distilleries in london and was alerted to four more.

the gangs often operate their distilleries in the back streets of deprived areas.

kostaz, from romania, who manages a still in southall, said: ""where i come from, this is not against the law.

""you can make rum and sell it if you want. so we are just bringing the tradition here.""

harry said doctors had advised him to stop drinking illegally-produced alcohol

in the uk it is unlawful to distil and sell alcohol without a proper licence.

hmrc said chemicals used in anti-freeze and screen wash had been discovered in some counterfeit spirits.

in a statement, hmrc said: ""the public health implications of counterfeit spirits are significant, and production of illicit alcohol is clearly a very dangerous activity.

""as a result, there is a risk that drinking counterfeit spirit can lead to permanent blindness, liver failure, kidney failure and can ultimately lead to death.""

however, the operators of the illegal stills were from countries where regulations are less strict.

some of the illegal distilleries can produce several litres of whisky, vodka and rum a day, costing as little as three pounds.

harry, an illegal immigrant, has been buying illegal alcohol for more than a year and said he was addicted.

he said: ""those guys lured me in with cheap whisky and now i am addicted and seriously ill.

dr james barker, from kingston university, said illegal alcohol could lead to significant health effects

""the doctors have told me that unless i stop, my future is going to hell.""

dr james barker, from kingston university's school of pharmacy and chemistry, analysed a sample of the illegal alcohol and said it could be toxic.

""people buying this don't know what they are letting themselves in for,"" said dr barker. ""if you drink too much of this stuff, you may never wake up.""

in terms ofhousing,the mayor sets affordable homes targets. they liaise with local authorities and developers who receive central government funding to build affordable homes.

the mayor has very few direct powers over theeconomy, but they can support businesses in the capital and control strategic planning, which means they can approve projects that will benefit london.

sex work, parties and overcrowding have all been uncovered in short-term let properties, a london council has said.

westminster city council is looking at 1,200 properties after it issued 75 breach notices to owners using online accommodation rental sites.

it said some households let properties to short-term guests on nearly every night of the year.

two of the bigger companies, airbnb and homeaway, said they had not received complaints from westminster council.

an airbnb spokesperson said: ""there are many home-sharing platforms in westminster.

""airbnb is the only one that works with london to promote the rules and limit how often hosts can share their homes - others need to step up and do the same.""

homeaway said it was working ""closely with the council to identify and address concerns and together with the short-term rental industry, we work on appropriate solutions for all parties involved"".

households must apply for planning permission if they want to let a property for more than 90 days a year.

airbnb said it did not allow users to accept more bookings than the legal limit, unless their owners have planning permission.

however, the council says landlords and tenants are sub-letting to get around airbnb's rules by offering the rooms on multiple platforms such as homeaway.

westminster city council said it had issued 75 breach notices to short-term let properties

council leader nickie aiken said some people may not know the 90-night limit exists,according to the local democracy reporting service.

but she warned the council was taking a tough approach, adding the proliferation of short-term visitors were upsetting residents in the borough.

she said: ""we have no problem with people earning a little extra money by letting their home considerately within the limits.

""but those who are breaching the 90-night limit and letting 365 days a year are a blight on the lives of our residents.""

it is estimated that in westminster there are 4,703 airbnb listings, comprising 3,284 entire homes, 1,378 private rooms, and 41-shared rooms.

westminster council has invested â£200,000 in a housing standards taskforce, which it set up last year.

sir sadiq khan has said london ""cannot afford"" to become a city where ""the centre has been hollowed out"" due to people working from home.

speaking at an event on wednesday, the mayor repeatedly outlined his concerns about the post-lockdown decline in office working across the capital, according to thelocal democracy reporting service.

he urged employers to encourage staff back into the office, but suggested companies had a responsibility to find ways to make the office environment more appealing for workers.

it comes asflexible working arrangements to allow staff to work from home are being restricted or brought to an endby some employers with offices based in london.

sir sadiq told the event, hosted by the consultancy firm project leaders, he was also concerned about young graduates entering their first jobs in the wake of the pandemic.

he said they may fail to strike up connections with their colleagues or acquire certain skills due to the lack of office working.

he added london's businesses should think ""very carefully"" before deciding to reduce their office space, as they may regret the longer-term impact on their staff.

the mayor stressed that london was not alone in having failed to return to pre-pandemic commuting levels, adding that it was proving a challenge for most other cities around the world â with the notable exception of some in asia.

companies also have a responsibility to find ways to make the office environment more appealing for workers, sir sadiq said

it follows moves by several companies in london to restrict or end remote working policies including amazon, the metropolitan police and global communications firm wpp.

for some companies, incentives are being used to encourage employees back into the workplace instead.

just eat for business, which asks staff to be in the office three days a week, offers an allowance for free food every month.

the rise in flexible working has also reduced transport for london's (tfl) revenue from fares.

as of march 2024, the number of tube journeys during morning peak hours on a monday stood at 70% of the level seen on the equivalent monday in march 2019. on friday mornings, the comparative rate was only 62%, whereas for tuesdays, wednesdays and thursdays, ridership stood at 79%.

in an attempt to address the collapse in ridership on fridays in particular, the mayor ran a â£24m reduced fare trial over three months last year, buta recent report found that it made ""no noticeable difference"" in the number of peak-time journeys on fridays.

in separate remarks, sir sadiq admitted he was still ""annoyed"" that hs2 would not be travelling further north than birmingham

one guest at the event told sir sadiq he felt his company was ""losing the battle"" in its attempts to persuade workers back into the office, due to the high cost of rail fares â particularly for those commuting from the home counties.

the mayor blamed private train operators for overseeing a series of above-inflationary fare increases, stressing he had tried to freeze tube and bus fares whenever possible.

he added he and his city hall team had lobbied the department for transport to consider ""innovative"" ways of making rail travel more attractive for commuters in and around london.

in separate remarks, sir sadiq admitted he was still ""annoyed"" that hs2 would not be travelling further north than birmingham, after the project'snorthern leg was axedby then-prime minister rishi sunak in 2023.

since taking power last year, the labour government has refused to commit to reinstating plans for a route as far as manchester, although it confirmed that trains will reach euston station, rather than terminating at old oak common in west london.

the government has been contacted for a response.

cielito canejo is a specialist respiratory practitioner. like many of her nhs colleagues in london, she experiences times of pressure and stress at work. the covid-19 pandemic caused her to reflect more on her mental well-being.

""the silver lining of the pandemic was that it raised awareness of mental health. for me personally, i no longer felt there was a stigma around it.""

while the pandemic is long over, the pressures on the nhs remain. ms canejo says she worries about the mental health of her colleagues across the sector.

the latest nhs staff survey, published on 13 march, has ranked london as the second worst region in england for morale and burnout (behind the east of england) - with a third of the capital's health workers saying they ""often or always"" feel burnt out because of the job.

london also scored worst in the category of ""work pressure"", with three quarters saying they experienced unrealistic time pressures in their job.

across the nhs, millions of workdays are lost each year due to mental health issues with workload, psychological distress and the pandemic's impact being blamed.

""we worked through the pandemic, serving the nation, and we've had no recovery,"" says dr chaand nagpaul, a north london gp.

""and since then, we've had to deal with the biggest backlog of care in the nhs.

""the number of patients needing to be seen far outweighs our capacity. this is a recipe for creating stress and burnout.""

he says his gp surgery is in an area with one of the lowest doctor-to-patient ratios in the country.

dr nagpaul adds that the capital has pockets of deprivation where health issues are more common.

in addition, he says, compared with some other parts of the country, london gps need more time, in order to provide care for patients who may have english as a second language and for asylum-seekers who may need more help with experiences of trauma.

dr nagpaul co-chairs the charity doctors in distress. it offers support groups and this year is holding an urgent fundraising appeal to help meet demand.

within the nhs, various services are offered to try to help staff with their mental health.

for example, london north west university healthcare nhs trust runs an in-house psychology service and offers on-site exercise sessions. it also brings support directly to staff in the form of a tea trolley.

""we go around with a 'well-being trolley'"", says aderemi shoyebo, ""bringing teas and coffees to staff who otherwise might not get a chance for a break.

""we use it as an opportunity to find out if there's anything they need help with and signpost them to support services.""

for ms canejo, what helped was journalling, and becoming a mental health first aid instructor. through helping others' mental well-being, she found it rewarding to her own.

an nhs london spokesperson said nhs staff were working ""incredibly hard to meet rising demand and care for more patients than ever before, and we know this can take a toll on wellbeing"".

""while there is more to do, the nhs is fully committed to ensuring staff get the support they need, and the health service is now offering more flexible working options than ever before, as well as a range of mental health support available for staff, including access to coaching and wellbeing resources.""

a department of health and social care spokesperson added: ""nhs staff have been overworked for years.

""through ourplan for change,externalwe are turning the nhs around and giving staff the tools they need to deliver the best possible care to patients.""

it has been three years since then prime minister boris johnson said we had to stay at home because of covid-19 and only go out for exercise or shopping.

in that time, the way many of us work and shop has completely changed.

data from the office for national statistics (ons) shows that before the pandemic, about 12% of adults reported working from home but - during the lockdown - almost of half of us were doing it.

lockdown may seem like a memory, but some of our habits have stuck.

hybrid working is here to stay, say managers

londoners have the highest levels ofhybrid working than anywhere else in great britain,with four in 10 balancing working from home with commuting into work, the ons data says.

and this is having an effect on businesses based near offices.

jennifer panxhi owns jen's plants and florist, just off brick lane, near the city.

she said she had to adapt and take her business online because of the lockdown: ""i thought, 'i'm not going to let the pandemic stop me'.

""the footfall has shrunk, however, we have a good presence on google,"" she added.

abia vizeoli runs smoko loko near liverpool street station. she said demand had fallen since the pandemic and she was now employing fewer staff.

""before it was six people, now it's only three,"" she said.

abia vizeoli's staff numbers have halved since the pandemic

ms vizeoli said she used to have people queue at her stall and hoped demand would return.

both business owners said the city was quiet on a friday; figures show londoners come into the office more during the middle of the week.

data from freespace, which tracks office usage, shows offices are half as busy as they were in 2020 on a monday in february.

richard burge, of the london chamber of commerce, said: ""it's becoming a very three-day-a-week city.

""it has a knock-on effect. that means the pubs and the restaurants don't open, or they're very under occupied.""

mr burge said it was going to be ""very hard"" for business owners to adapt to the change in work pattern.

businesses still want to maintain an office presence in london

despite the move to remote working, some business owners still want to have a presence in the capital.

lewis beck, of cbre, a global firm that advises businesses on real estate, said: ""central london office take-up is now only 6% lower than pre-pandemic levels.""

he added businesses had to ""earn the commute"", with offices being designed to provide something staff could not get at home.

the pandemic took many lives and many lost livelihoods. london seems to be recovering but the ons figures reveal a different way of working in the capital has emerged.

two young londoners, zara and serena, have told the bbc about the struggle they went through to find work and how vital support schemes like kickstart can be for people like them.

zara now has a short-term placement at an arts charity

zara said her time job hunting was ""very stressful"" until she secured a placement at an arts charity, where she is picking up key computing skills.

she said: ""a lot of people think you're just being a bum, that it's easy to go out and get a job.

""it's not easy to just go out and get a job -- that's why we're in this position in the first place.""

serena is now working in events management

serena was working as a checkout assistant before she got her big break with a job in events management.

she said: ""it's frustrating when you know you have the skillset but you just don't have access, that foot in the door, to the industry where you want to work.

""when you're constantly applying and either not getting a response or getting a negative response back, it's just about keeping going and about networking to find opportunities.""

manny hothi, chief executive at trust for london, outlined the barriers young people face when it comes to finding and keeping a job that support schemes like kickstart can help them overcome.

he said: ""one common barrier is lacking contacts in and knowledge of growth sectors, such as tech and life sciences.

""another is needing to improve 'soft' skills such as communication and timekeeping.

""some young people are not able to afford commuting costs, particularly if they are on lower wages.""

repurpose kickstart scheme funding to create london kickstart plus - which would provide support for disadvantaged young londoners.

offer early entry to the restart programme and other programmes, and more intensive day one support, to those coming off furlough and those who have more barriers to getting a job.

extend, with transport for london, the zip card scheme to londoners aged 18-24 for the first six months of employment, as cost of travel is proving a barrier to employment.

reform the apprenticeship levy to provide clear incentives to employers to offer entry-level apprenticeships.

gain a fair share of the uk shared prosperity fund and adult education budget for london - to fund employment and skills projects for young people and more broadly.

councillor darren rodwell, deputy chair of london councils, a cross-party group representing the capital's 32 borough councils and the city, urged the chancellor to recognise the value of these schemes and ramp up support for london's 107,000 unemployed young people, so they could get the same opportunities.

""it can't be right that london has a higher than average rate of young people unemployed,"" he said.

""we need our young people to be ready for tomorrow's jobs.""

mr rodwell said london had suffered the worst impact of the pandemic as the country's business hub, which had further damaged young people's job prospects.

he urged the chancellor not to start ""levelling down"" support for the capital's unemployedin the budget.",not mentioned,not mentioned

a collection of street art by banksy, removed from walls, has gone on display at a london hotel before the works are sold at auction.

the seven artworks on show include no ball games, liverpool rat and girl with balloon.

banksy said the exhibition did not have his consent. auction house bonhams said buyers should be wary of buying artwork which had not been authenticated.

organiser sincura group said it ""sensitively salvages"" artwork.

no ball games was stencilled by banksy on a wall in london

banksy's 2rat mural has been valued at â£200,000

director tony baxter said the company had not gained financially from any sales of banksy's street work, and that it did not ""steal or condone any acts of vandalism or theft"".

the practice has attracted critics, with protests being held against the removal and auction of a slave labour mural which was on the side of a poundland store in wood green, north london.

ina statement,external, mr baxter said: ""the sincura group are approached by building owners to remove the artwork illegally painted on their sites.

""the building owners have not asked for the art to be placed on their premises or for the on-going attention received from it.

""what is more, they run the very real risk of having a grade 2 listing applied to their premises which seriously affects their business operations and resale value. though loved by the public these are often a hindrance to the building owners.""

on hiswebsite, banksy,externalsaid: ""the stealing banksy exhibition in london has been organised without the involvement of consent of the artist... this show has got nothing to do with me and i think it's disgusting people are allowed to go around displaying art on walls without getting permission.""

banksy recently created this mural in cheltenham; however it has since been vandalised

protests were held when a banksy in north london was removed from the side of a poundland store

ralph taylor, the director of the uk board of contemporary art at bonhams, said sincura was trying to establish a market in selling banksys and to do that, this exhibition had the aim of generating credibility.

""none of the art work has been authenticated so whether they are sellable is a moot point,"" he said.

in 2008, banksy set up pest control to verify his artworks, however it only authenticates canvases and prints created by the artist, not his street works.

""people need to know what they are buying,"" said mr taylor, adding: ""bonhams and other auction houses would not entertain the selling of an artwork which doesn't have a certificate of authenticity.

""street artworks are easy to replicate as people could just download a stencil. without the signature flourishes of an artist's paint brush it is harder to verify. it just seems to me to be a bit of a brick wall.

""it is up to the living artist to say what is legitimate or not.""

the artworks are on display at me london on the strand until sunday. entry costs â£17.50.

the sincura group said an auction using online and sealed bids would conclude on sunday.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-43065705,London-registered minicabs 'working in other cities',2018,"drivers for private hire operators like uber can take jobs far from where they are registered

more than 3,600 transport for london (tfl)-registered private hire drivers have addresses as far away as bradford and cardiff.

letters released by the mayor of london's office show there were 747 tfl-registered minicab drivers in birmingham and 378 in bristol.

it means local councils in those areas have no control over drivers' licensing or the number of cabs on their roads.

sadiq khan has asked the government for greater licensing powers.

he is calling on the department for transport (dft) for powers to cut the number of licences issued in london and for minicab journeys to begin or end where the driver is registered.

a tfl map included in the letters, and released after a bbc freedom of information request, shows how far these drivers are from the capital.

the dft said it was monitoring concerns about private hire licensing.

analysis: bbc london transport correspondent tom edwards

it will come as no surprise to many that minicab regulations are again being shown up as unfit for purpose.

there is meant to be something called a ""triple licensing lock"" where a job from a passenger can only be accepted if the vehicle, the driver and the booking are under the jurisdiction of the same authority - in this case tfl.

but the lock doesn't work anymore, because minicab apps like uber means drivers can quite legitimately live and work anywhere in the uk even though they are registered under tfl. you can use the uber app anywhere to find a car: in the past you'd ring a local number or go to a local shop.

we now have a situation where local authorities across the country, as far north as blackburn, bradford and york, have no jurisdiction over tfl minicabs in their own towns.

tfl has even sent officials to places such as brighton because there are so many tfl drivers there.

the mayor wants a change in the law so the journey has to start or end in the area the minicab is licensed. but at the moment, technology has again outpaced regulation.

london-registered drivers are living far from the capital

steve wright, chairman of the licensed private hire car association, criticised the mayor's proposed ban on cross-border hiring, saying it would make the current situation worse.

""it would be overly prohibitive, and wouldn't solve the problem of app users showing themselves available in areas far from where they are licensed,"" he said.

""it would also have a catastrophic effect on the environment, as drivers would have to return to the area they were registered to start new jobs, leading to them driving many dead miles.""

a spokesperson for uber said it would be introducing changes that mean in future drivers will only be able to use the app within the region in which they are licensed.

a mayor of london spokesperson said: ""it's time the government gave sadiq the power to cap these numbers and also urgently end the ridiculous practice of drivers being licensed in one area with the sole intention of working elsewhere in the country.""

the dft said: ""the licensing of taxis and private hire vehicles is a matter for local authorities. however we are aware of the concerns regarding the changing landscape of the market, and continue to monitor this.""","private hire, shop",not mentioned

london's poverty profile (pdf),external, which is compiled by the new policy institute, looked at the effects of the housing boom and how london had recovered from the recession.

while the number of pensioners in poverty has fallen by 30% in the last decade, both housing and work have become more insecure, with more families in temporary or private rented accommodation.

the average private rent in london is now â£1,600 a month, more than double the average for england.

on monday 10 november, civil enforcement officers in bromley will embark on action short of a strike for a week, after pay talks with their employer broke down.

bromley traffic wardens who are gmb union members rejected car park operator apcoa's offer of â£13 an hour, which they say is substantially lower than the pay equivalent workers receive in neighbouring boroughs, and also below thelondon living wageof â£14.80.

according to the union, apcoa employees performing the same roles in lambeth and wandsworth earn â£15 an hour.

union members voted to take action last month on a turnout of 72%.

they say they ""just want fair pay and respect for the job we do"", with ""bad weather, short staffing and constant public pressure"" a feature of their work.

the industrial action will see traffic wardens performing only their contractual duties and no voluntary or discretionary tasks.

they will not issue pcns ""beyond what is strictly required"" and will decline non-contractual overtime or extra duties.

as required under the road traffic act, they will be prioritising keeping traffic moving safely and efficiently.

according to the union, ""their role will focus solely on maintaining road safety and compliance by encouraging drivers to move on where necessary"".

the gmb said the action was likely to cause serious disruption to parking enforcement across the borough.

gmb regional organiser craig prickett said: ""apcoa's offer of â£13 an hour is unacceptable when other contractors in similar roles are being paid significantly more. our claim for â£17 per hour is reasonable, benchmarked against other companies in the sector and reflects the responsibility of the role.

""bromley council can't hide behind its contractor â they commission and profit from this contract, and the workers who deliver it deserve a proper wage. our members will maintain the contract, but they will do only what they are paid to do, nothing more.

""we call on apcoa and bromley council to come to the table with a meaningful offer â not a few pence here and a few pence there, which is just further frustrating the members.""

a council spokesperson said: ""as we have previously outlined, we are aware of ongoing discussions between the employer and employee representatives and, whilst we are hopeful for a positive outcome, it would not be appropriate for the council to comment given that the council is not the employer.""

part-time work is growing fast in london, but much of it is poorly paid, according to the london assembly.

mothers in the capital face particular difficulty in finding jobs that enable them to combine work with childcare.

only 60% of women with dependent children are in work compared with 69% in the rest of the uk.

and nearly half of all 18-24 year-olds and part-time staff are paid less than the london living wage (llw) of â£9.40 per hour.

unlike older workers, under-25s cannot top up their pay with means-tested benefits.

more than two-thirds of hotel workers now earn less than the llw, as do more than half of retail staff, and the proportions have grown since the financial crisis of 2008.

the assembly's report calls on the next mayor to consider making the llw compulsory for all london businesses by 2020.

less than half of shopworkers earn the london living wage

it says the current mayor, boris johnson, has ""fallen short of the mark"" in his aim to create ""fulfilling"" jobs for londoners, prioritising the quantity of jobs over their quality.

""many londoners are unable to work to their potential, using neither their full talent nor flair,"" it says.

""london's economy, while successful, is not as productive as pre-recession trends implied; and many of the available jobs, particularly in the low pay sectors, are far from fulfilling.""

a spokesman for mr johnson said: ""the mayor has worked tirelessly to ensure all londoners have access to fulfilling and sustainable jobs.

""the number of companies paying the london living wage increased from 27 in 2008 to more than 700 today.""

fiona twycross, the chair of the london assembly economy committee, said women would struggle to return to work after having children if they were not paid enough to cover the cost of childcare.

""partly it's the attitude that it's difficult to have people working flexibly.... it's still unusual for people to be jobsharing.

""it's a shame for the individuals concerned, and it's not good for the economy if we're not using women returning to work at their full capacity.""

emma stewart, the joint ceo of the timewise foundation, said people who wanted a ""quality"" job advertised as part-time were fishing in a market that constituted 3% of advertised vacancies.

""women downgrade. the answer is to encourage employers to think about how open they could be to part-time or flexible working at the point of hire.""

pret a manger has been fined â£800,000 after a worker was stuck in a walk-in freezer for two and a half hours.

the employee, wearing only jeans and a t-shirt, tried to keep warm by moving around but feared for her life and was treated for suspected hypothermia.

after the incident in london in 2021, it was found there had been no suitable risk assessment.

the chain pleaded guilty to a health and safety offence at westminster magistrates' court on tuesday.

westminster city council, which investigated the incident, said the worker became trapped in the freezer, which typically had its temperature set at -18c, at the chain's victoria coach station shop on 29 july that year.

she was eventually found in a state of distress by a colleague.

while in the freezer, she found her breathing was becoming restricted and she began to lose sensation in her thighs and feet.

at one point, she tried to tear up a cardboard box to use as cover from the ventilator blowing out cold air, but her hands were too cold to break it.

an investigation found there was no suitable risk assessment for employees working in temperature-controlled environments.

pret's reporting system revealed there had been several call-outs relating to defective or frozen push buttons in the previous 19 months.

on one occasion at the same remote kitchen, a worker became stuck in the walk-in freezer after being unable to open the door from the inside. in that incident in january 2020, the internal door release mechanism was not working.

westminster city council's deputy leader and cabinet member for communities, public protection and licensing, aicha less, said: ""overlooking basic safety measures can have the most serious consequences.

""we hope the significant fine awarded in court acts to all businesses as a warning.""

a pret a manger spokesman said: ""we have carried out a full review and have worked with the manufacturer to develop a solution to stop this from happening again.

banksy has confirmed that he is behind a new artwork that appeared in north london on sunday.

the street artistuploaded before and after pictures of the finsbury park mural to social media on monday,external.

it shows green paint sprayed on a wall behind a cut-back tree to look like foliage, with a stencil of a person holding a sprayer next to it.

crowds have gathered to see the mural, with one local saying they were ""proud"" their street had been chosen.

""it feels like a personal message to us residents, we just feel so proud,"" said wanja sellers, who lives along the street from the mural.

former labour leader jeremy corbyn told the pa news agency he was ""delighted"" to see the artwork in his islington north constituency.

""banksy's come to finsbury park with a bit of greenery in a place that needs a bit more greenery. we're the most densely populated constituency in the country and i'm just delighted,"" the mp said.

the mural shows a ""great arterial spray of green paint"" across a white wall, accompanied by a ""classic banksy-style stencil"", according to james peak, who createdthe bbc radio 4 series the banksy story.

he says it probably would have been created using a pressure hose or fire extinguisher.

the colour of the green paint used matches that used by islington council for signs in the local area, which mr peak said demonstrated banksy's eye for detail.

""when you step back it looks like the tree is bursting to life, but in a noticeably fake and synthetic way.

""it's spring now, and this tree should be bursting forth with leaves, but banksy must have cycled past and thought how miserable it looks,"" he said.

before the artist confirmed it was his piece of work, islington councillor flora williamson said it would be ""incredible"" to have a banksy artwork ""right in the middle of social housing and one of the poorest parts of the borough"".

""i think it adds intrigue and culture and brings the area to life,"" she said.

islington council said its graffiti removal team is aware of the artwork and won't remove it.

the council believes the cherry tree in the foreground of the artwork is around 40-50 years old and is in declining health, with decay and fungi damage.

it says it has been maintaining and pruning the tree for some time - both for safety, and to help prolong its lifespan - and will continue working to keep the tree alive.

the elusive artist usually confirms his work on his website and social media, and on monday he posted images of the artwork on instagram with no caption.

in his post, the starkly bare tree can also be seen with a plain white wall behind it - prior to creation of the mural.

alex georgiou, whose company owns the building with the mural on, said he found out about it late on sunday night, and came down to see it for the first time the morning after.

he said the building was currently vacant and on the rental market.

""the question is, what do i do with it now? what am i meant to do with it now? i definitely plan on keeping it on there and letting people enjoy it, everyone's loving it which is great, i just can't really believe it, still, to be honest,"" he said.

banksy is one of the world's most famous artists, but his identity remains, officially at least, unknown.

his most famous works includekissing coppers(2004) and girl with balloon (2006),which was shredded in a stunt following its sale at auction in 2018.

the artist's most recent known piece, a stop sign with three military drones on it, was stolen just hours after it had been confirmed as authentic in december last year.

in february,two men were re-bailed for theft, with officers still trying to track down the artwork, which was taken from a south london street.

speaking to bbc radio 4's today programme, mr peak said that by incorporating a tree into the artwork, banksy has ""solved an emerging problem"" of people trying to steal his work.

several of the chocolate bars seized in the raid on 6 september were not labelled in english, meaning consumers were unable to check the products for ingredients, sell-by dates or allergens, the council said.

trading standards teams also uncovered lucky charms cereal with more than double the uk limit for artificial food colourings.

the shop had been found to be selling ""carcinogenic"" american sweets back in february, the council said.

in the past three months, 2,374 non-compliant products were destroyed from the premises.

these included swedish fish and hot tamales sweets, which are banned in the uk.

women are finding it harder to work in london than the rest of the country because of the costs of transport and childcare, according to a report.

cuts in benefits and tax credits since the financial crisis are further reasonscited by the gla (greater london authority) economics study.,external

it finds 60% of women with children, who are eligible to work, have a job in london.

that compares with just under 70% across the country, the report says.

the mayor of london's office said it was ""working to increase the number of flexible and good quality paid jobs for women"".

since 2008, part-time jobs in the capital have increased by nearly a quarter - to 1.6 million - compared to a 9% increase in the uk.

however, women are not getting the same access to work as elsewhere, thepart-time employment in london report,externalsaid.

it said the costs of transport and childcare are barriers to women returning to work, with childcare costs in london 28% higher than the british average, according to the daycare trust.

childcare costs in london are 28% higher than the british average according to the daycare trust.

because 34% of people use public transport in london, both the time it takes to travel and the price of fares reduce the incentive to get part-time work, gla economics said.

""the costs of travelling to work are likely to be higher in london than elsewhere in the uk,"" it says.

""the choice of whether to work part-time needs to factor in higher opportunity costs for working as compared  to those working full-time.

""longer journey times mean subtracting time from other important activities such as childcare, and because this is more expensive in london, it may well not pay for some to take a part-time job.""

but another major factor is that the tax and benefit system does not compensate for london's higher cost of living, according to the report.

it says the coalition government's abolition of the in work credit allowance removed one way of giving eligible londoners a premium to offset higher living costs.

""other changes to the welfare system, affecting couples with children in particular, have occurred and are likely to continue to occur in the future (e.g. universal credit).

""if these policy changes do not take into account london's circumstances, the relative disincentive to take work in london (as compared to the rest of the country) could remain or become higher still.""

karen buck, labour mp for westminster north, said the high cost of living in the capital had been exacerbated by low pay.

recent research by the trades union congress (tuc) suggested in six boroughs -  bexley, newham, merton, harrow, redbridge and waltham forest - the majority of female part-time workers earn less than the london living wage of â£8.80 an hour.

""london needs a better deal on childcare, improvements in the minimum wage and faster progress towards the living wage,"" ms buck said.

a mayor of london spokesman said: ""the mayor is looking at ways to work with employers to improve and increase the number of flexible and good quality paid jobs for women, particularly those with childcare responsibilities.

""he has introduced a part-time travelcard with transport for london and plans to commission employment programmes focused on supporting parents who are out of work or in low paid work to access good quality sustainable jobs.""",not mentioned,british

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce8vggkgzr2o,Delivery riders getting illegal e-bikes seized,2024,"most of the riders who had illegally modified e-bikes seized in the city of london in the past year were food deliverers trying to get a faster vehicle to do their job, the head of a specialist unit seizing the bikes has said.

new figures released by 27 police forces to the pa news agency show a steep increase in the number of seizures of e-bikes which have been illegally modified to go faster than 15.5mph - the speed at which they are required to cut out under uk law.

speaking to the bbc, city of london police's sgt stuart ford, who leads the cycle response unit, explained the vehicles did not need to be insured and the ""vast majority"" of the ones his force seized were used by deliverers.

in response to the bbc, food delivery service deliveroo said it would not work with any riders caught using illegally modified e-bikes.

the broad term 'e-bike' is commonly used for any electric-powered bike, but it can actually refer to very different types of equipment which are covered by different laws.

e-bikes: what is the law and is there an age limit?

bikes which have a small electrical motor which helps cyclists to move the pedals have the 15.5mph (25 kph) speed limit, and their motors cannot exceed 250 watts of power.

these are electrically assisted pedal cycles (eapc), and under the law these are treated the same as a bicycle and therefore riders do not have to seek insurance.

illegal e-bikes are more powerful and reach higher speeds, and are not necessarily illegal in themselves - but under the law they are classified as motorcycles, and should not be driven without a licence on the roads.

modification kits, some of which are sold for as little as â£300, can also be used on regular bicycles and allow them to potentially reach speeds as fast as 60mph.

across the uk, figures show 937 illegal e-bikes were seized in the year to 11 august - up from 511 in the previous 12 months, an 83% increase.

the pa news agency received responses to freedom of information requests from 27 out of 46 police forces it contacted.

among the forces with the largest year-on-year increases in e-bike seizures were wiltshire police (from 24 to 64), police scotland (from 60 to 233), derbyshire police (from four to 23), northumbria police (from 18 to 58) and south wales police (from 66 to 137).

city of london police recorded 295 seizures, which was more than any other police force that provided figures - although it did not have a comparable number for the year before.

speaking to bbc radio 4's today programme, sgt ford was asked if most of the e-bikes being seized were used by delivery riders.

he said this was true in ""the vast majority of cases"".

""especially... ones which are are being adapted,"" he said.

""so theyâll buy a normal bike, and then theyâll buy a kit online of batteries - which are unstable in a lot of cases - throttles and rear hub motors that will turn them into mopeds basically.""

the police force, which is responsible for policing the square mile in central london, set up its cycle response unit in july last yearin response to community concerns about road safety and anti-social behaviour,external.

earlier this year, city of london ch supt rob atkin,externalsaid: ""some people have told us that they have nearly been hit and have seen riders mount pavements and run through red lights.""

a spokesperson for deliveroo said it takes its ""responsibilities seriously to ensure the safety of riders and the communities where we operate"".

""riders are required to use legal and roadworthy vehicles at all times, and as with all road users, they must follow local traffic laws and regulations.""

efforts have been made to tighten up the rules for cyclists generally, and specifically for anyone using illegal e-bikes.

prior to the conclusion of the last parliament, legislation spearheaded by tory mp iain duncan smith wouldhave made dangerous cycling a specific offence.

the law change, which would have come in as part of an amendment to the criminal justice bill, was not passed in time for the end of the last parliament.

speaking on bbc radio 4's today programme, duncan smith said he would continue to campaign for a change in the law.

""itâs getting [cyclists] within the highway code, so that dangerous cycling, or cycling that causes death or injury, are prosecutable offences. and for cyclists to understand theyâre not above the law,"" he said.",delivery,not mentioned

as crime increases in central london's popular nightlife hotspots, according to a council report, a group of volunteers are working to keep revellers safe.

westminster city council reported an 11% increase in sexual offences in the borough - 84% of those victims were women.

the authority's night stars provide an all-round service to those who could become vulnerable on a night out, armed with vomit bags, alarms, drink spiking test kits, plastic drink covers and flip-flops.

âitâs really rewarding,â said volunteer emmanuella fadire. âyou help a lot of people and make them feel safe. you also have a nice time out and get a lot of people thanking you.â

as the councilâs womenâs safety and hate crime officer, ms fadire leads the stars on most shifts.

at the start of a night shift, she hands out walkie-talkies and leads the volunteers out of their hub at st anneâs church on dean street.

ms fadire says she has helped many people in her six years as a volunteer then employee - from consoling those who have had their belongings stolen to protecting women from being followed by men they do not know.

âeveryone deserves a fun night out,â she said.

the night stars engage with as many as 20 people a night

the night stars began patrolling london's partying hotspots in march 2022 to assist anyone who becomes vulnerable due to intoxication get home safely.

they hand out water and sweets to help people sober up. ms fadire said flip-flops were often the most popular item in stock.

âwe give them to people who have maybe lost their shoes or are just walking around barefoot,"" she said.

âa lot of people are either happy or confused by them.â

volunteers could engage with as many as 20 people a night, ms fadire said.

rebecca damm, 45, who started volunteering six months ago, said: âafter midnight, it gets different - it feels a bit darker, the energy.

âit feels a little more chaotic and when it gets chaotic, you feel people can become more vulnerable and then you get more people, perhaps, approaching vulnerable people.â

ms damm said: âwe see a lot of young women come out of bars and lurkers start to walk over and befriend them. i havenât seen a group of girls not handle themselves but you can see the lurkers waiting for that kick out.""

rebecca damm, left, and emmanuella fadire often tour soho as night stars

daniel khalid, 24, has been volunteering for five years and said he would see the same men loitering around.

greek street had been a particular trouble spot but things were ""getting betterâ, he said.

given the tourist hotspots they work in, the night stars often help holidaymakers.

on one occasion, the team helped a family visiting from denmark find accommodation after an issue with their booking.

ms damm said: âthey came back and gave us a card and sweets as a thank you. they also made a donation.â

westminster city council's annual survey found a third of women in the borough had had a personal experience of street harassment, and 45% reported feeling unsafe at night.

crime has also doubled in two years to on average 216 incidents a day and is costing the council â£371m, according to an analysis of crime figures.

the majority of these (60%) were theft offences with many happening in the west end or st jamesâs at night.

the same research found westminster city recorded more than 90,000 criminal offences, more than double the next highest borough.

in response, businesses are being trained in stamping out sexual harassment in their venues.

councillor iman less says the scheme provides women with more security on nights out

labour councillor iman less, the council's nightlife champion, said: âour main priority is to make sure you get home. we have a different role to the police. we have a different role to the ambulance. we have a different role to security or bar staff.â

ms less said the night stars could provide women with an ""added sense of security"".

estella adeyeri from the good night out campaign, said the night stars provided a ""vital service the police cannot"".

she said in a climate where ""trust in policing is so low, providing an avenue for people to seek help without incriminating themselves is important"".

the 34-year-old communications coordinator said: âif someoneâs over-intoxicated, maybe because theyâve consumed an illegal substance, theyâre still vulnerable.

""they might not want to approach someone who is going to criminalise that activity rather than looking at their vulnerability, looking at them without any judgement and saying, âyou know, that person just needs helpâ.""

to ms fadire, there is no silver bullet to making a night-out safer.

instead, she suggests rethinking how we licence venues selling cheap drinks and wants establishments to do more to help patrons sober up before leaving.

the met police has been contacted for comment.

illegal skin-whitening creams are being sold by high street cosmetics shops despite a number of prosecutions, a bbc undercover investigation has revealed.

shaba hair and cosmetics stores have been fined for dealing in creams containing hydroquinone but researchers found outlets continuing to sell them.

products containing hydroquinone can damage the liver and nervous system.

trading standards officials said there was ""no excuse"" for selling the creams. shaba declined to comment.

skin-lightening products containing hydroquinone are widely used throughout india and sub-saharan africa - although some countries haveoutlawedthe ingredient.

shaba director banaras hussain has been prosecuted for selling the banned creams at his shops on three previous occasions - in enfield, dalston and peckham.

he was fined â£11,792 over the peckham sales alone, and is due in court on 1 april for sentencing after pleading guilty to 33 offences related to the dalston shop.

but after a tip-off, the bbc found shaba outlets continuing to deal in banned skin lightening creams under the auspices of mr hussain.

at shaba hair and cosmetics (peckham) an undercover researcher was sold a jar of 'caro light' cream priced at â£9.99 that listed hydroquinone as an ingredient.

manufactured in the democratic republic of congo, when tested it was found to contain 4.6% hydroquinone - more than twice as powerful as the strongest medicine containing hydroquinone licensed for prescription for medical purposes by a uk doctor.

this shaba staff member revealed that products contained hydroquinone despite it not being listed on the packaging

the cream was sold in a black bag from under the counter. when the researcher asked for a receipt, an assistant asked mr hussain in urdu: ""brother, i have given her the goods and now she wants a receipt. should i give it to her or not?""

in response, mr hussain tore off the name and address of the shop before handing the receipt over.

at shaba cosmetics ltd in dalston, a member of staff informed the bbc that three products displayed on the shelves contained hydroquinone - despite it not even being listed as an ingredient.

the worker admitted the sale of the product was not allowed. two of the creams were subsequently found to contain the chemical.

when confronted with the evidence, mr hussain made no comment.

sarah oladokun stopped using skin lightening creams after they caused harm to her skin

sarah oladokun, a 19-year-old beauty blogger from peckham, used skin-lightening creams when she was younger. she said: ""my skin became patchy, very uneven, which then caused problems for me because i didn't know how to balance it out.

""so instead of me stopping i would continue to put more on the darker areas.

""these are organised, often gangs, of cyclists that will come in and snatch phones. they even have adapted sticky gloves to be able to grab the phones easily,"" says sgt ford.

in the summer of 2022, the force recorded a steep rise in reported phone snatching offences, hitting a record high of 143 in july.

city of london police's cycle response unit has been brought back to help target phone snatchers

to tackle it, the force reintroduced its cycle response unit, which it says was disbanded in 2011.

sgt ford says the unit's officers deploy to hotspot areas, which often deters thieves, and are able to pursue suspects through areas that are not accessible to vehicles.

figures for past year show the number of recorded phone snatching offences fell by 11% compared with the year before.

the officers also speak to members of the public, advising them about phone thieves operating in the area.

""if you need to use your phone, just duck into a doorway,"" sgt ford suggests to one couple.

he points out the steady stream of people walking along the street, heads down, with their phones in their hands.

the force is also concerned about another group of people who are using illegal e-bikes and e-scooters.

among those seized by police, we spot an e-bike with just eat branding on it.

sgt ford explains many of the riders they have stopped tell them they are delivery drivers.

""the delivery drivers are using them because they haven't got to pay for the insurance and licences and tests to ride a moped, when they can go and buy a fairly cheap bicycle, and then go and buy a kit for â£300-â£400, get it fixed on to the bicycle, and they'll go 30mph plus.""

riders of illegal e-bikes face having them seized and a â£300 fine

he says the force is trying to engage with the delivery companies to take more action.

just eat said in a statement that the safety of couriers and the public was ""a key priority"" and that all couriers must follow the law.

âwe take a zero-tolerance approach to illegal vehicle use and if we are ever made aware that a courier delivering on our behalf has acted in a way that does not uphold the standards we hope to deliver, we do not hesitate in taking action, which could include revoking the courier from our network.â

sgt ford says there is much more work to do to take dangerous e-bikes and e-scooters off the road.

""but we hope the more we seize, the more the message will be out there,""  he adds.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-13113801,London 2012: Thames cable car work to start in summer,2011,"work to build a â£50m cable car across the river thames in london, linking two olympic venues, will begin this summer.

transport for london (tfl) said it was ""striving"" to complete the connection before next year's games but warned this would be ""an extremely challenging timeline for a complex project"".

it will run from the o2 arena in north greenwich to the excel exhibition centre at the royal victoria docks.

it will be part of the oyster card network but fares have yet to be set.

last year tfl said it would not be funding the cable car but now it has decided to pay for the project up front.

this was to help its ""quick delivery"", a spokesman said.

while the company would be trying to recoup its costs, it could not guarantee that no money would have to come from taxpayers, he added.

the consortium which will build and run the cable car is to be led by mace.

the firm worked on the london eye and is currently constructing the shard tower at london bridge, south-east london.

london's mayor, boris johnson, said: ""gliding serenely through the air across the thames will provide a truly sublime, bird's eye view of our wonderful city.

""this innovative airborne travel link will be a vital component in the ongoing renaissance of a vibrant easterly quarter of the capital, providing a much-needed river crossing.""

but a labour member of the london assembly, john biggs, argued the cable car was ""no substitute"" for a bridge across the thames.

""i've no objection to what will be a fantastic attraction, but this is not a serious solution to the real transport needs for the area, and no substitute for what we really need - a new road crossing.""

and the project's cost was queried by caroline pidgeon, who leads the liberal democrats on the assembly.

""the mayor must now come clean and state why as recently as july 2010 he was claiming the cable car would cost â£25m, but already its projected cost has doubled.""

she also called on mr johnson to explain why he ""was boasting"" of a privately-funded cable car last year, when it was now to be paid for by tfl.",delivery,not mentioned

london tube workers are to go on strike in the new year in a dispute about pay, the rail, maritime and transport union (rmt) has announced.

union members who work on different parts of the underground will walk out on separate days between 5 and 12 january.

it comes after rmt members voted overwhelminglyto take industrial action over a 5% pay offer.

transport for london (tfl) said the pay rise was ""the most we can afford"".

rmt general secretary mick lynch said tube workers who helped bring ""vast amounts of value"" to the london economy would not put up with senior managers and commissioners ""raking it in"", while they were given ""modest below-inflation offers"".

he called on tfl to ""improve their offer to avert disruption in the capital"".

a spokesperson for tfl said: ""we have been clear throughout our productive discussions with our trade unions that this offer is the most we can afford whilst ensuring that we can operate safely, reliably and sustainably.

""we encourage the rmt to engage with us to avoid disruption for londoners at the start of next year.""

the protest, which started at 14:00 bst, is set to last for two hours.

members of the united cabbies group are taking part in the protest, as they said illegal minicab touting is ""out of control"".

they also said minicabs are being driven without insurance and the regulated taxi trade was under threat.

side streets around oxford street are also jammed with cabs, said bbc london's tom edwards

there has been outcry by drivers recently over the widespread use of taxi apps such as uber.

len martin, from the united cabbies groups, told bbc london 94.9: ""every single night there are a number of touting incidents taking place every single night on the streets of london.

""i'd like to see a good deal more enforcement officers on the street.""

garrett emmerson, from transport for london (tfl), told the bbc: ""to say the situation is out of control or is growing in some way is completely wrong.

thousands of london underground staff will not go on strike but will instead refuse to work overtime or rest days in a dispute over safety.

the rail, maritime and transport workers (rmt) union is taking the action claiming job cuts had made working on the tube ""horrific"".

in the rmt ballot, 85% of station workers voted to strike but 94% opted for action short of a walkout.

london underground (lu) urged the union to ""work with us constructively"".

drivers on the piccadilly line have also backed action over a ""wholesale breakdown"" in industrial relations.

he said: ""the rmt will not stand by while safety is compromised on london underground off the back of cash-led cuts to staffing levels that the union has warned would have a serious, lasting and corrosive impact for staff and passengers alike.""

transport for london said both ballots had low turnouts with 33% voting in the ballot over staffing and safety and 49% voting in the piccadilly line dispute.

transport for london (tfl) said more than a third of bus routes ran during the 24-hour action which ended at 03:00 bst but ""many routes were disrupted"".

members of unite employed by 17 bus firms walked out over a â£500 bonus.

but those working with london general, arriva, the shires, and metroline did not join in after the firms won an injunction against the strike action.

unite's regional secretary in london, peter kavanagh, said support for the action was ""solid"" and showed bus workers were ""willing to stand shoulder to shoulder to get the recognition they deserve in keeping london moving during the olympics. ""

he added the action came ""as bus operators hide behind an anti-democratic court injunction and refuse to settle the dispute.""

""we will fight to get the injunction overturned and further action will be bigger if tfl and the bus operators continue to bury their head in the sand,"" he said.

unite estimates it would cost â£14m to provide a â£500 bonus for every bus driver.

deals have been announced giving workers at heathrow express â£700, network rail â£500, docklands light railway â£900, london overground â£600 and london underground at least â£850, unite said.

tfl commissioner peter hendy said over a third of bus services had been in operation during the strike action.

tfl added passenger numbers were up by about 18% across the tube, london overground and docklands light railway and no significant change in usage was seen in hire bike services.

it claimed that was because the average bus journey is just 2.2 miles long, suggesting many had chosen to walk instead.

it is understood the workers who went on strike represented about 85% of the total workforce.

london mayor boris johnson said the strike was ""extremely frustrating"" and added: ""i can only conclude that this strike is being driven by hardline trades union militancy and a desire to have a strike for political purposes.""

unite representative mr kavanagh said: ""the strike should be a wake-up call to the bus companies and tfl.

""they now need to negotiate meaningfully about rewarding bus workers for the massive increase in workload they will face over the olympics.""

tfl commissioner mr hendy said: ""it is now clear that the leadership of unite were intent on a strike all along.

""they have pursued this unnecessary course of action despite an extra â£8.3m being brokered by the mayor that would allow every bus driver in london in a garage where one or more routes were affected by the 2012 games to gain, over the 29 days of the competitions, about â£500.""",not mentioned,not mentioned

more research needs to be done on the effect working at night has on people's health, the mayor of london said.

sadiq khan and the capital's night czar amy lamã© heard of health issues faced by night workers during a wellbeing event held in vauxhall on thursday.

the mayor called for the government to recognise the ""distinct needs of night workers"", with his office saying 1.3m people work between 18:00 and 06:00.

the government said there were protections in place for night workers.

according to research by consultancy firm the liminal space, which hosted thursday's event, people who work at night are 37% more likely to have a heart attack.

they are 44% more likely to have diabetes, the research added.

the study also said people who work at night are six times more likely to get divorced than those who work during the day.

sarah douglas, director at the liminal space, called night workers a ""hidden army that keep our 24/7 society running"".

at her company's wellbeing event, staff at fire nightclub described the impact their work has, from ""terrible headaches"" to getting ""four or five hours"" of sleep a night.

ms lamã© said: ""we talk a lot about the health implications but not so much around the emotional implications of working at night.""

mr khan called on the government to commission more research into how the impact of working at night could be reduced.

the government said protections already in place for night workers included free health assessments to see if they are fit to work nights.

islington council has been been ranked as the best single-tier local authority in the country for efforts to tackle climate change, with the greater london authority (gla) being awarded best for combined authorities.

climate emergency uk's ""climate scorecard"" rankings were based on actions taken by councils towards becoming net zero.

in a statement, islington council's environment chief, rowena champion said the news marked a ""recognition of all our efforts"".

so far, the council said it had taken steps such as decarbonising islington's waste recycling centre, electrifying and shrinking the size of its vehicle fleet, and ""working hard"" to retrofit its social housing stock.

champion added: ""we know that people in islington care deeply about the environment, so we are working hard to empower local people and businesses to take steps to help lower carbon and make islington greener and healthier.""

she said islington was one of six london boroughs ""most susceptible"" to climate change, and as such, there was a ""large potential impact"" for residents.

following islington's declaration of a climate emergency in 2019, the local authority  said it had set ""ambitious targets"" to tackle climate change.

climate emergency uk's assessment of the council was carried out between july 2024 and march 2025.

top 10 local authorities in the climate scorecard:

reacting to the rankings, isaac beevor, partnerships director of climate emergency uk, said the organisation was ""pleased to see councils using scorecards to improve"".

however, he called on the government to make climate action a fully-funded legal duty.

climate emergency uk said that overall, uk councils' net zero progress had been ""slow"".

""the 2025 highest scores are mostly seen in london council where the [gla] already has a legal duty to act on climate action,"" it added.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-67101982,Cost of Living: One in four working London parents struggle to feed family,2023,"the felix project said a quarter of people skipped meals or didn't buy food so their children could eat

one in four working parents in london are struggling to feed their families, according to a food charity.

the felix project surveyed more than 2,000 working parents in the capital, with a quarter saying they skipped meals or didn't buy food for themselves so their children could eat.

its research also suggests 11% of london's working families have less than â£3 a day to spend on food.

it comes amid high inflation rates and an increased cost of living.

the felix project said as a result, 14% of respondents have turned to a food support service like a foodbank for the first time in the last year.

one of those struggling is wendy lam-vechi,who bbc london spoke to last month.

she said she'd started collecting food past its best-before date when the family's mortgage and living costs increased.

ms lam-vechi, from greenwich in south-east london, is now using a food-sharing app in order to feed her family, and walks one or two hours across the city to collect leftover food.

wendy lam-vechi says she uses a food-sharing app to get food throughout the week

ms lam-vechi said sharing food is not something she ever imagined doing, as her husband's job in it used to support the whole family.

""we never used to spend that much, milk used to be a pound and now it's gone up... so we started cutting back on luxuries like cheese, yoghurt, and no more crisps,"" she said.

the mum of two, who is not working to save on childcare costs, said the family went into an overdraft and her husband started skipping breakfast and lunch, filling up on biscuits instead.

""it got to the point where i said, 'this isn't right, we shouldn't be struggling so much just feeding our family',"" she said.

after doing research online ms lam-vechi said she came acrossfood-sharing app olio.

she found someone giving away three large loaves of bread and thought ""wow, i can actually make something - i made bread and butter pudding, i ended up making sandwiches for lunch"".

shane dorsett, director of operations at the felix project, says many people would be ""very surprised"" at the kinds of people struggling.

shane dorsett said many working people are now turning to food service organisations to feed their families

""people who have never used food service organisations before are these days showing up.

""people who go to work every day, sometimes they have more than one job, are now using food banks,"" he said.

this is something that ""really shocked"" ms lam-vechi too, who said: ""i always thought to be in this current situation i would have to be homeless or both of us not working, but my husband is actually earning an average salary.""

the felix project's ceo, charlotte hill obe, said there is ""a huge demand for food support services"", which emphasises ""the dire need among working families"".

""every single one of the charities we support wants more food and there are over 650 new organisations on our waiting list that we cannot help.""

ms lam-vechi said she is trying to spread the word about food-sharing apps, but feels ""quite sad there's not enough help out there"".

""there are food banks, but in order to get one you have to apply and there's not an easy way of getting it,"" she explained, adding it took a long time for her to find a solution.

""it's helped me so much. i can't express how i can look at our bank account and actually have money at the end of the month,"" she added.

""i want people to know you don't have to go through this struggle of feeding your family when there are other means of doing it.""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgejgenlvd0o,Bus drivers warn of fatigue and poor conditions,2024,"drivers marched through london to highlight their concerns

lorraine robertson was a london bus driver for 17 years before she gave it up, as it was becoming ""harder and harder"" and she felt it unsafe.

the buses were becoming more crowded, the breaks insufficient, and the conditions uncomfortable.

she was one of the current and former drivers who marched through the capital on tuesday to highlight their concerns. fatigue and a lack of toilet facilities were among the problems they believe need tackling.

transport for london (tfl) has said it takes drivers welfare seriously and it is working on a range of measures to improve working conditions, health and wellbeing.

lorraine robertson said she left the job as a bus driver as conditions were getting more and more difficult

ms robertson said passengers, pedestrians and cyclists were making the job more difficult, and little support was coming from the bus companies.

""the buses are getting more and more packed, it's unsafe conditions - the passengers don't care. the cabs are freezing in the winter and too hot in the summer. where's it all going to end?

""if you do a12-hour shift and you get a 40-minute break, in that 40 minutes, you've got to leave your bus, find somewhere to go, go to the toilet, wash your hands and have something to eat.

""then you do a 12-hour shift - you get to the other end of the route, and what used to be called recovery time, now they call it stand time, used to be 10 to 15 minutes. now it's lucky to get five minutes. some stand times have been cut to three minutes. it's no time at all.

""it's just too stressful. you go home and you're tired. driving is tiring mentally. your passengers are your priority. we have to make sure that they are safe. i think people need to be more aware and be kinder to us.""

some of the marchers bore placards and union flags

ms robertson is just one of those calling for better conditions.

since 2014, 80 people have died in collisions involving buses.

their families - including that ofkathleen finnegan who died at victoria bus station- recently said changes needed to be made.

""we want to see how they investigate these incidents and we want to see if the bus contracts are having an indirect impact on safety,"" they said.

tfl previously said safety was its ""utmost priority"" and it was ""committed to learning from every collision as part of our vision zero goal to eliminate death and serious injury on the network"".
