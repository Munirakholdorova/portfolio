The data corpus for this study was sourced exclusively from BBC News. Initially, other newspapers, including The Guardian and The Times, were considered; however, due to accessibility constraints and limitations in data retrieval, the scope was narrowed to BBC News alone. A significant challenge encountered during data collection was the limited availability of information pertaining specifically to the topic of "illegal work in London." While the initial plan was to focus on the timeframe from 2021 to 2025, the scarcity of relevant articles necessitated an expansion of the temporal range. Consequently, the dataset spans from 2014 to 2025, allowing for a more comprehensive examination of trends and patterns related to undocumented labor in London.
To identify relevant articles, a keyword strategy was employed, primarily using the term "illegal worker," which facilitated the retrieval of content directly addressing the subject matter. The subsequent step in the research process was to compile the textual data from all collected URLs into a structured CSV file for analysis. This was accomplished using the Trafilatura library, a tool specifically chosen for its reliability in extracting the complete body of English-language BBC articles. By utilizing Trafilatura, the research ensured that the textual data was both comprehensive and accurately captured, providing a robust foundation for subsequent qualitative and quantitative analysis. The use of BBC News as a sole source is justified by its reputation for journalistic rigor, extensive coverage of UK labor issues, and accessibility of digital archives, which collectively contribute to the credibility and relevance of the dataset.
Overall, this methodological approach enabled the creation of a high-quality, longitudinal corpus of textual data on illegal work in London, balancing both the need for temporal breadth and the specificity required to address the research question effectively.
