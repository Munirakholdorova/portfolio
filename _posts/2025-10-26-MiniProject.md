We are pleased to announce the successful completion of our first mini-project, which focused on digitizing a historical Ismaili manuscript from Gilgit-Baltistan.

This project allowed us to gain hands-on experience with the full digitization workflow, including scanning, OCR, metadata creation, and the use of digital humanities tools such as Python and GitHub.

The outcomes and insights from this project are detailed on our project description page, which can be accessed here [Mini Project](https://munirakholdorova.github.io/portfolio/Digitization/)
