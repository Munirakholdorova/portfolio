### Mini Project Proposal: Digital Analysis of Trust, Risk, and Reputation in Undocumented Migrant Labour Networks

For my Mini Project, I will study a small collection of texts connected to my dissertation topic on how undocumented migrants in the UK find work through informal social networks. Because these workers are often hidden from official records, most available information comes from interviews, personal stories, and NGO reports. By applying digital methods to these texts, I hope to understand how migrants describe their routes into work and how trust, risk, and reputation shape these difficult situations.

### My corpus will come from three public sources. The first is King’s College London’s London’s Undocumented Workers project, [which includes interviews and thematic reports about work conditions] (https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/londons-undocumented-workers). The second is JCWI’s We Are Here report, [which contains anonymised stories about migrants’ job experiences] (https://www.jcwi.org.uk/we-are-here). The third source is a set of reports from FLEX, such as Unsafe and Unseen and Risky Work, [which include interview excerpts and descriptions of informal recruitment](https://www.labourexploitation.org). These texts together provide interview extracts, short narratives, and personal accounts that will form the basis of my digital analysis.

## My main research question is: Why do undocumented migrants rely on informal social networks to access work, and how do trust, risk, and reputation influence these relationships? To explore this, I plan to use keyword analysis, topic modelling, and simple entity extraction to identify recurring themes, the language used to describe risk and trust, and the social actors involved. I may also look briefly at sentiment patterns to see how migrants express fear, support, or uncertainty around different types of work contacts.

## There are some challenges I expect. Many texts are anonymised, which can make identifying people or networks difficult. The corpus is small and varied in style, so some digital methods may not work as well as they do on larger datasets. Ethical considerations are also important, because the topic involves a vulnerable group and sensitive material. Finally, the interview-style narratives can be uneven or fragmented, which can make computational analysis less straightforward.

## Despite these issues, I believe the project will offer useful insights. Combining digital tools with close reading may help me highlight how undocumented migrants talk about trust, risk, and relationships when finding work, contributing to a better understanding of hidden labour markets in the UK.
