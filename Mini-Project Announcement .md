## mini-project 2-2: 

This mini-project explores how illegal working in the UK is represented in BBC News reporting. It focuses on building and analysing a corpus of news articles using digital methods such as keyword tagging, geographic data extraction, and data visualisation. Through this process, the project introduces practical approaches to transforming unstructured news texts into structured, analyzable data.
